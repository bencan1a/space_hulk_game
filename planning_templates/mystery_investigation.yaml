# Example Scenes
example_scenes:
  opening:
    location: "Mysteriously intact bridge with crew dead at stations"
    description: "The bridge is pristine, untouched by the chaos elsewhere. Crew members sit at their stations, long dead but showing no signs of violence. The captain's log is still recording. Systems still online. What happened here? More importantly: why is everything still working?"
    mood: "Puzzling, eerie calmness hiding deeper mystery"
    sensory_details:
      - "Soft hum of functioning systems"
      - "Dust settling on ancient uniforms"
      - "Blinking console lights in rhythm"
      - "Recycled air, stale but breathable"
  
  middle:
    location: "Data archive with corrupted but recoverable logs"
    description: "The archive holds terabytes of ship data, but something has systematically corrupted specific files. The pattern of corruption is deliberate - someone wanted certain information hidden. Your tech-priest identifies the deletion timestamps: all within the same hour, centuries ago. What were they trying to hide?"
    mood: "Intellectual challenge, sense of uncovering conspiracy"
    sensory_details:
      - "Cool glow of data-screens"
      - "Rhythmic clicks of ancient storage drives"
      - "Ozone smell from overworked cogitators"
      - "Your own focused concentration"
  
  climax:
    location: "Hidden chamber containing the truth"
    description: "Behind the false bulkhead lies a chamber no ship blueprint shows. Inside: evidence of what really happened. The pieces finally fit. The crew didn't die - they chose death rather than live with what they'd discovered. And now you know it too. The question is: will you make the same choice?"
    mood: "Revelation, 'eureka' moment, burden of knowledge"
    sensory_details:
      - "Ancient air unsealed for first time in centuries"
      - "Evidence laid out like a confession"
      - "Your heart pounding with understanding"
      - "The weight of terrible knowledge"

# Example Puzzles
example_puzzles:
  deduction:
    name: "The Timeline Reconstruction"
    description: "Multiple data sources provide contradictory timestamps. Ship's log says one thing, crew personal logs another, security footage shows third version. Must cross-reference to determine actual sequence of events and identify who was lying."
    solution_hint: "Compare all sources, identify impossible claims, reconstruct true timeline"
    difficulty: "medium"
    investigation_element: "Logical analysis of conflicting evidence"
  
  technical:
    name: "The Encrypted Archive"
    description: "Critical data is encrypted with a cipher that requires understanding of ship's history. Clues to the key are scattered across the hulk in the form of crew personal effects, ship name variations, and historical references."
    solution_hint: "Gather background information, connect historical dots, synthesize the key"
    difficulty: "high"
    investigation_element: "Information gathering across multiple locations"
  
  forensic:
    name: "The Crime Scene"
    description: "A scene of apparent conflict, but something doesn't add up. Blast patterns inconsistent with weapon types. Blood spatter suggests impossible movements. Bodies arranged unnaturally. What really happened here requires careful observation and reconstruction."
    solution_hint: "Examine all details, test theories against evidence, identify staging"
    difficulty: "high"
    investigation_element: "Forensic analysis and reconstruction"

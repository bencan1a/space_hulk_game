# Example Scenes
example_scenes:
  opening:
    location: "Damaged shuttle bay, only escape craft damaged"
    description: "The impact threw you clear of your shuttle. Around you, alarms shriek warnings of hull breaches and radiation leaks. Your suit display shows 4 hours of oxygen remaining. The shuttle is a twisted wreck - repairable, perhaps, but you'll need parts. And time you don't have. The Space Hulk groans around you, beginning its death throes."
    mood: "Immediate danger, clock is ticking"
    sensory_details:
      - "Alarm klaxons echoing through corridors"
      - "Hiss of escaping atmosphere"
      - "Suit oxygen counter ticking down"
      - "Metallic taste of fear"
  
  middle:
    location: "Reactor control room, systems failing"
    description: "The reactor is past critical. You have maybe 90 minutes before it goes. The evacuation route you planned is blocked by the coolant leak - radiation levels are lethal. There's another way, through the genestealer nest, but you're almost out of ammunition. Or you could try to stabilize the reactor - but that means using your last radiation meds now, leaving nothing for the journey ahead."
    mood: "Impossible choices, mounting pressure"
    sensory_details:
      - "Geiger counter clicking faster"
      - "Heat bleeding through armor"
      - "Sweat stinging eyes"
      - "Countdown timer burning in vision"
  
  climax:
    location: "Final escape corridor to functioning shuttle"
    description: "The hull is tearing apart around you. 30 seconds of oxygen left. The shuttle is visible ahead, engines already warming. Between you and safety: a hundred meters of corridor buckling under stress. You can hear the genestealers behind you. Your weapon is empty. There's only forward now - run, and don't look back."
    mood: "All-in desperation, now or never"
    sensory_details:
      - "Own ragged breathing in helmet"
      - "Screech of tearing metal"
      - "Alien shrieks growing closer"
      - "Red emergency lights strobing"

# Example Puzzles
example_puzzles:
  resource_allocation:
    name: "The Medical Supply Dilemma"
    description: "Found a medical cache with 3 doses of radiation meds. You need 2 to safely traverse the radioactive zone. Wounded teammate needs 2 to survive their injuries. The cache also has blood-clotting foam that might keep them alive with only 1 med dose, but it's unreliable. What do you do?"
    solution_hint: "No perfect answer - choose survival priority or risk teammate for better chances"
    difficulty: "medium"
    survival_element: "Resource scarcity forces difficult moral choice"
  
  path_choice:
    name: "The Three Routes"
    description: "Three paths to the escape ship. Fast route through vacuum (burns oxygen fast). Medium route through unstable sections (risk of cave-ins). Slow route around (safe but eats into time limit). Ship launches in 2 hours regardless."
    solution_hint: "Balance speed, safety, and resources based on current state"
    difficulty: "medium"
    survival_element: "Risk vs. reward calculation under pressure"
  
  sacrifice:
    name: "The Airlock Sequence"
    description: "To open the path forward, someone must manually override the airlock from inside - meaning they'll be vented to space when it cycles. The controls are broken from your side. Team is already down to 4 members. Who makes the sacrifice?"
    solution_hint: "Volunteer, choose, or find alternative (risky/time-consuming bypass)"
    difficulty: "high"
    survival_element: "Ultimate cost for progress"

# Project Plans

This directory contains development planning documents and architectural documentation.

## Contents

### Planning Documents
- **productContext.md** - Project architecture and technical overview
- **activeContext.md** - Current development focus and status
- **progress.md** - Project timeline and completed milestones
- **decisionLog.md** - Architectural and design decisions with rationale
- **ARCHITECTURAL_ANALYSIS.md** - Comprehensive system architecture analysis
- **PROJECT_RESTART_PLAN.md** - Detailed project completion roadmap
- **phase1_implementation_plan.md** - Phase 1 implementation details
- **phase2_implementation_plan.md** - Phase 2 implementation details

## Purpose

This folder serves as the working space for:
1. **Development Planning** - Architectural decisions, implementation plans, and progress tracking
2. **Historical Context** - Record of how the project evolved and why decisions were made

**Note**: Agent-generated game configuration files (YAML) are now in the `game-config/` directory as they are product code, not planning documents.

## For AI Assistants

When working with this repository:
- Reference planning documents here for architectural context
- Update planning documents as the project evolves
- Do not create new top-level markdown files for planning - add them here instead
- Game configuration YAML files belong in `game-config/`, not here

# Project Plans

This directory contains development planning documents and ephemeral agent working files.

## Contents

### Planning Documents
- **productContext.md** - Project architecture and technical overview
- **activeContext.md** - Current development focus and status
- **progress.md** - Project timeline and completed milestones
- **decisionLog.md** - Architectural and design decisions with rationale
- **ARCHITECTURAL_ANALYSIS.md** - Comprehensive system architecture analysis
- **PROJECT_RESTART_PLAN.md** - Detailed project completion roadmap
- **phase1_implementation_plan.md** - Phase 1 implementation details
- **phase2_implementation_plan.md** - Phase 2 implementation details

### Agent Output Files (Gitignored)
These YAML files are generated by the CrewAI agents during execution and are gitignored as they are ephemeral:
- **plot_outline.yaml** - Generated narrative plot structure
- **narrative_map.yaml** - Generated scene connections and flow
- **puzzle_design.yaml** - Generated puzzles and game elements
- **scene_texts.yaml** - Generated scene descriptions and dialogue
- **prd_document.yaml** - Generated product requirements document

**Note**: The YAML files are regenerated each time the crew runs, so they are not committed to version control.

## Purpose

This folder serves as the working space for:
1. **Development Planning** - Architectural decisions, implementation plans, and progress tracking
2. **Agent Outputs** - Temporary files generated by AI agents during game content creation
3. **Historical Context** - Record of how the project evolved and why decisions were made

## For AI Assistants

When working with this repository:
- Reference planning documents here for architectural context
- Generate agent output files (*.yaml) to this directory
- Update planning documents as the project evolves
- Do not create new top-level markdown files for planning - add them here instead

## Current Sprint (Week of Nov 10, 2025)

**Focus:** Phase 4 Game Engine - CRITICAL PATH 🎯

**Goals:**
- [x] Execute Chunk 4.1: Game State Model - ✅ COMPLETE
- [ ] Execute Chunk 4.2: Command Parser
- [ ] Execute Chunk 4.3: Game Engine Core
- [ ] Execute Chunk 4.4: Content Loader
- [ ] Execute Chunk 4.5: Game Validator
- [ ] Execute Chunk 4.6: Demo Game & Integration

**Active Work:**
- Chunk 4.1 COMPLETE (100% - all deliverables finished, 68 tests passing)
- Ready to proceed with Chunk 4.2 (Command Parser)

**Blockers (Non-Critical):** 
- Output format issue: LLM generates markdown instead of YAML (evaluators handle this)
- Evaluation task failures: Tasks 6-11 encounter LLM errors (can use 5-task mode for MVP)

- Validated all evaluators against real generated files

**Results:**
- All 7 modules completed (46.5KB total code)
- All 18 unit tests passing (100% success rate)
- All 32 quality tests passing (14 metrics + 18 evaluators)
- Each evaluator returns standardized QualityScore with actionable feedback
- Real file validation results:
  - narrative_map.yaml: ✅ PASS (10.0/10.0) - Excellent quality
  - puzzle_design.yaml: ✅ PASS (9.0/10.0) - Excellent quality
  - plot_outline.yaml: ❌ FAIL (0.0/10.0) - YAML parse error
  - scene_texts.yaml: ❌ FAIL (0.9/10.0) - Insufficient scenes
  - prd_document.yaml: ❌ FAIL (3.1/10.0) - Insufficient systems
  - Average score: 4.6/10.0

- All 14 unit tests passing (100% success rate)
- Metrics provide objective scoring (0-10 scale)
- Clear pass/fail thresholds defined for each metric
- Real file validation results:
  - Narrative Map: ✅ PASS (10.0/10.0)
  - Puzzle Design: ✅ PASS (9.0/10.0)
  - Plot Outline: ⚠️ Parse error (markdown wrapped)
  - Scene Texts: ❌ FAIL (0.9/10.0)
  - Mechanics: ❌ FAIL (3.1/10.0)

**Findings:**
1. Quality metrics system successfully provides objective evaluation
2. Metrics correctly identify issues in generated content
3. Scoring system provides granular feedback (not just pass/fail)
4. Metrics handle markdown-wrapped YAML (common LLM output format)
5. Real generated files have quality issues that metrics detect:
   - Scenes need more content (only 1 scene vs minimum 5)
   - Mechanics need more systems (only 1 vs minimum 3)
   - Plot parsing issue due to YAML syntax in LLM output

**Decisions:**
- ✅ Chunk 3.1 complete and validated
- ✅ Ready for Chunk 3.2 (Quality Evaluators)
- 📋 Consider addressing LLM output format in Phase 5
- 📋 Quality metrics will be valuable for Phase 4 game engine validation

**Deliverables:**

### 2025-11-09 (Late Evening) - Chunk 0.4 Complete
**Activities:**
- Executed Chunk 0.4: Hierarchical mode validation (optional)
- Created test script: tests/test_hierarchical_minimal.py (267 lines)
- Configured 3-task minimal hierarchical crew setup
- Ran hierarchical mode test with manager delegation
- Monitored for hanging/timeout (10 minute limit)
- Captured and analyzed LLM response failure
- Created comprehensive analysis document

**Results:**
- Hierarchical mode failed after 2.23 minutes (133.61 seconds)
- Error: "Invalid response from LLM call - None or empty"
- Manager delegation initiated but failed during execution
- No output files created (0/3)
- Failure point clearly identified and documented

**Findings:**
1. Hierarchical mode **not production-ready** (as expected)
2. Manager delegation adds complexity that breaks LLM responses
3. Sequential mode is the correct choice for MVP
4. Failure is consistent and reproducible
5. Root cause: Complex delegation prompts → LLM timeout/empty response

**Decisions:**
- ✅ Hierarchical mode validation complete - failure documented
- ✅ Sequential mode confirmed as production approach
- ✅ Phase 0 validation now 100% complete
- ✅ Ready to proceed to Phase 4 (Game Engine)
- 📋 Defer hierarchical mode improvements to post-MVP

- All runs generated all 5 output files
- No performance degradation across runs
- Core tasks (1-5) successful in all runs
- Evaluation tasks (6-11) failed with LLM errors
- Output format issue confirmed across all runs

**Findings:**
1. Core content generation pipeline is **stable and fast**
2. System handles multiple prompts reliably

4. Output format (markdown wrapping) needs post-processing
5. Evaluation tasks need stability improvements

**Decisions:**

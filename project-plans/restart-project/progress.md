## Current Sprint (Week of Nov 9, 2025)

**Focus:** Phase 0 Validation Testing

**Goals:**
- [x] Execute Chunk 0.1: Validate sequential mode with 5 core tasks - ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
- [ ] Fix output format issues from Chunk 0.1
- [x] Execute Chunk 0.2: Validate sequential mode with all 11 tasks - ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
- [x] Execute Chunk 0.3: Reliability testing (3 consecutive runs) - ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
- [x] Document validation results - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Decide: Proceed to Phase 4 or debug issues - ✅ PROCEED TO PHASE 4

**Blockers (Non-Critical):** 
- Output format issue: LLM generates markdown instead of YAML (workaround possible)
- Evaluation task failures: Tasks 6-11 encounter LLM errors (can use 5-task mode for MVP)

## Work Log

### 2025-11-09 (Evening)
**Activities:**
- Executed Chunk 0.3: Reliability testing with 3 consecutive runs
- Installed all dependencies via pip install -e .
- Ran automated test script (tests/run_chunk_03.py)
- Monitored execution for ~13 minutes total
- Analyzed results and failure patterns
- Created comprehensive execution summary

**Results:**
- All 3 runs completed with different prompts
- Average execution time: 4.24 minutes (excellent performance)
- All runs generated all 5 output files
- No performance degradation across runs
- Core tasks (1-5) successful in all runs
- Evaluation tasks (6-11) failed with LLM errors
- Output format issue confirmed across all runs

**Findings:**
1. Core content generation pipeline is **stable and fast**
2. System handles multiple prompts reliably
3. No memory leaks or performance issues
4. Output format (markdown wrapping) needs post-processing
5. Evaluation tasks need stability improvements

**Decisions:**

- ✅ Proceed to Phase 4 (Game Engine) - critical path
- 📋 Defer output format fixes to Phase 5 (Output Validation)
- 📋 Defer evaluation task improvements to Phase 3 (Quality System)
- 📋 Use 5-task mode for MVP development

**Next Actions:**

## Decision Log

### Recent Decisions

**2025-11-09 (Evening): Phase 0 Complete - Proceed to Phase 4**
- Decision: Core validation complete, ready for Phase 4 development
- Rationale: 
  - Core tasks (1-5) work reliably across all 3 test runs
  - Performance exceeds targets (4.24 min vs 10 min goal)
  - System is stable with no degradation
  - Known issues have workarounds and can be fixed in later phases
- Impact: Can begin game engine development (critical path)
- Status: Approved - Phase 4 is next priority

**2025-11-09 (Evening): Defer Output Format & Evaluation Fixes**
- Decision: Document issues but don't block on fixes
- Rationale:
  - Output format can be post-processed manually for MVP
  - Evaluation tasks optional (5-task mode produces all needed files)
  - Fixing these requires significant prompt engineering effort
  - More valuable to build game engine to validate content usefulness
- Impact: Faster path to MVP, fixes planned for Phase 3 & 5
- Status: Documented in chunk_03_summary.md

**2025-11-09: Unified Planning Documents**
- Decision: Create single master_implementation_plan
- Rationale: Two plans (project + revised) were confusing
- Impact: Clear single source of truth
- Status: Implemented

**2025-11-09: Verified Phase 1 & 2 Completion**
- Decision: Confirmed Phase 1 & 2 were implemented in March 2025
- Rationale: Code exploration revealed all described features exist
- Impact: Updated all planning docs to reflect completion status
- Status: Documented in CODE_VERIFICATION.md

**2025-11-09: Prioritize Game Engine**
- Decision: Phase 4 is critical path, must complete for MVP
- Rationale: Can't validate generated content without engine
- Impact: Will focus on Phase 4 after Phase 0
- Status: Planned

**2025-11-08: Keep Current Architecture**
- Decision: No rewrite, continue with CrewAI hierarchical design
- Rationale: Architecture is sound, aligns with best practices
- Impact: Save weeks of rewrite effort
- Status: Confirmed

**2025-03-02: Sequential Mode as Default (Historical)**
- Decision: Use sequential process by default, hierarchical optional
- Rationale: Sequential is more reliable, easier to debug
- Impact: Reduced complexity, improved reliability
- Status: Implemented

# Phase 2 Implementation Plan: Narrative-Driven Hierarchical Structure

## Overview

Phase 2 transforms the Space Hulk Game CrewAI implementation from a linear flow to a narrative-driven hierarchical structure. This architectural enhancement ensures that narrative cohesion drives all aspects of development, with clear sequential dependencies between specialists and regular integration checkpoints.

## Implementation Goals

1. Establish a Narrative Director Agent (formerly Game Director) to coordinate the narrative-driven process
2. Create strict sequential dependencies to ensure narrative foundations before specialized development
3. Implement continuous collaboration through context-specific directives
4. Add integration checkpoints to validate all elements against narrative requirements
5. Convert process flow from sequential to hierarchical using existing CrewAI mechanisms

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Narrative Director Agent Definition

The Narrative Director Agent will ensure narrative cohesion across all game elements, serving as the central authority for the narrative-driven development process.

**YAML Configuration for agents.yaml:**

```yaml
NarrativeDirectorAgent:
  role: "Narrative Director"
  goal: "Ensure narrative cohesion and thematic consistency across all game elements through a structured development process driven by strong narrative foundations."
  description: "The Narrative Director oversees the entire game creation workflow, maintaining narrative as the central pillar of development. They coordinate the efforts of specialized agents, provide context-specific directives, and verify all elements align with the established narrative framework."
  backstory: >
    A master storyteller with extensive experience directing narrative-driven game development.
    Having crafted numerous critically acclaimed interactive narratives, the Narrative Director
    understands how to weave gameplay mechanics, environmental storytelling, character development,
    and player agency into a cohesive whole. Their expertise lies in maintaining the integrity of the
    narrative vision throughout all aspects of development, ensuring that every puzzle, scene,
    and game mechanic serves the overarching story in meaningful ways. They excel at guiding
    specialized teams toward creating experiences where narrative and gameplay are seamlessly integrated.
  tools: []
  allow_delegation: True
  verbose: True
```

### 2. Restructured Task Dependencies

```

### 3. Add Corresponding Methods to crew.py

Add methods for the Narrative Director Agent and all new evaluation tasks:

```python
@agent
def NarrativeDirectorAgent(self) -> Agent:
    """
    Returns the NarrativeDirectorAgent definition from agents.yaml.
    
    This agent ensures narrative cohesion across all game elements and
    coordinates the narrative-driven development process.
    """
    logger.info(f"Creating NarrativeDirectorAgent with config: {self.agents_config.get('NarrativeDirectorAgent')}")
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config["NarrativeDirectorAgent"],
        verbose=True
    )

@task
def EvaluateNarrativeFoundation(self) -> Task:
    """
    The EvaluateNarrativeFoundation task from tasks.yaml.
    """
    logger.info(f"Creating EvaluateNarrativeFoundation task with config: {self.tasks_config.get('EvaluateNarrativeFoundation')}")
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config["EvaluateNarrativeFoundation"]
    )

@task
def EvaluateNarrativeStructure(self) -> Task:
    """
    The EvaluateNarrativeStructure task from tasks.yaml.
    """
    logger.info(f"Creating EvaluateNarrativeStructure task with config: {self.tasks_config.get('EvaluateNarrativeStructure')}")
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config["EvaluateNarrativeStructure"]
    )

@task
def NarrativeIntegrationCheckPuzzles(self) -> Task:
    """
    The NarrativeIntegrationCheckPuzzles task from tasks.yaml.
    """
    logger.info(f"Creating NarrativeIntegrationCheckPuzzles task with config: {self.tasks_config.get('NarrativeIntegrationCheckPuzzles')}")
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config["NarrativeIntegrationCheckPuzzles"]
    )

@task
def NarrativeIntegrationCheckScenes(self) -> Task:
    """
    The NarrativeIntegrationCheckScenes task from tasks.yaml.
    """
    logger.info(f"Creating NarrativeIntegrationCheckScenes task with config: {self.tasks_config.get('NarrativeIntegrationCheckScenes')}")
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config["NarrativeIntegrationCheckScenes"]
    )

@task
def NarrativeIntegrationCheckMechanics(self) -> Task:
    """
    The NarrativeIntegrationCheckMechanics task from tasks.yaml.
    """
    logger.info(f"Creating NarrativeIntegrationCheckMechanics task with config: {self.tasks_config.get('NarrativeIntegrationCheckMechanics')}")
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config["NarrativeIntegrationCheckMechanics"]
    )

@task
def FinalNarrativeIntegration(self) -> Task:
    """
    The FinalNarrativeIntegration task from tasks.yaml.
    """
    logger.info(f"Creating FinalNarrativeIntegration task with config: {self.tasks_config.get('FinalNarrativeIntegration')}")
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config["FinalNarrativeIntegration"]
    )
```

### 4. Update Crew Definition to Hierarchical

Update the crew method to use hierarchical process flow with the Narrative Director as the manager:

```python
@crew
def crew(self) -> Crew:
    """
    Returns an instance of the Crew with a hierarchical process flow.
    The Narrative Director Agent manages the narrative-driven development process.
    """
    return Crew(
        agents=self.agents,    # collected automatically by @agent decorators
        tasks=self.tasks,      # collected automatically by @task decorators
        process=Process.hierarchical,  # Use hierarchical process
        verbose=True
    )
```

```

## Testing Plan

1. **Narrative Foundation Test**:
   - Verify that the Plot Master Agent creates a comprehensive narrative foundation
   - Confirm the Narrative Director properly evaluates the foundation
   - Test the quality gate to ensure development doesn't proceed without approval

2. **Narrative Structure Test**:
   - Verify that the Narrative Architect develops a detailed structure based on the approved foundation
   - Confirm the Narrative Director properly evaluates the structure
   - Test the quality gate to ensure specialist work doesn't fully proceed without approval

3. **Integration Checkpoint Tests**:
   - Verify that each specialist creates content clearly connected to the narrative
   - Confirm the Narrative Director performs effective integration checks
   - Test that feedback leads to improved narrative cohesion

4. **End-to-End Test**:
   - Run a complete game generation process with the narrative-driven approach
   - Verify all components maintain narrative cohesion throughout
   - Confirm the final product delivers a consistent narrative experience

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing Phase 2:

1. The system will enforce narrative as the central pillar driving all development
2. Clear sequential dependencies will ensure proper foundations before specialized work
3. Integration checkpoints will maintain narrative cohesion across all game elements
4. The quality of the narrative experience will improve through enforced consistency
5. Players will experience a more cohesive, thematically consistent game

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Phase 2, we will be ready to proceed to Phase 3: Planning Integration, which will enhance the system's ability to develop strategic plans while maintaining the narrative-driven approach.

## Additional Considerations

- This implementation uses only existing CrewAI mechanisms (hierarchical process, task dependencies)
- The task dependency structure enforces the narrative-driven development approach
- The strict quality gates ensure proper foundations before specialized development
- The revised task descriptions provide context-specific directives to specialists
- Regular integration checkpoints validate all elements against narrative requirements

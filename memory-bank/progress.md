## Completed Tasks

### 3/2/2025
- Created Memory Bank structure
- Documented project architecture and agent system
- Analyzed existing code and configuration files
- Established documentation standards
- Created token-efficient CrewAI API reference for AI assistant use
- Documented core CrewAI components: agents, tasks, tools, flows, knowledge, processes, LLMs, memory, and planning
- Updated codebase to use improved agent, task, and crew implementations:
  - Replaced old crew.py with improved version from crew2.py
  - Updated agents.yaml with more specialized text adventure development roles
  - Updated tasks.yaml with more detailed text adventure creation workflow
  - Updated main.py to import from the correct module
  - Maintained code organization while removing the "2" suffix from filenames
- Conducted comprehensive analysis of the Space Hulk Game system architecture
- Created detailed improvement plan focusing on:
  - Hierarchical process flow with Game Director Agent
  - Planning capabilities for improved coordination
  - Specialized output formats for different content types
  - Iterative refinement through feedback loops
  - Error handling and validation mechanisms
- Created detailed implementation plan for Phase 1: Syntax & Bug Fixes
- Implemented Phase 1: Simplified Code and Fixed Bugs:
  - Enhanced input validation in the `prepare_inputs` method
  - Removed task-specific validation that relied on non-existent decorators
  - Maintained error handling with recovery mechanisms
  - Created tests for core functionality
  - Fixed import issues with crewAI project module

## In Progress

- Preparing for implementation of Phase 2: Hierarchical Structure
  - Planning Game Director Agent configuration
  - Designing hierarchical process flow integration
  - Planning standardized output formats for different content types

## Backlog

- Implement Game Director Agent in agents.yaml
- Update crew.py to use hierarchical process flow
- Enable planning capabilities in the crew definition
- Define schemas for structured output formats (JSON, YAML)
- Implement shared memory for retaining context across iterations
- Create hooks for quality thresholds and revision triggers
- Develop version control for tracking content evolution
- Document player interaction flow
- Create architectural decision records for major design choices
- Standardize documentation for new features
- Evaluate potential improvements based on comprehensive CrewAI framework understanding

## Development History

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Code Refactoring (Completed)
- Project repository created
- Basic crewAI framework implemented
- Agent roles and tasks defined
- Game concept established based on Space Hulk theme
- Comprehensive CrewAI API reference created
- Codebase updated to use improved agent, task, and crew implementations
- Simplified code by removing non-existent decorators and validation methods
- Fixed import issues and updated tests

### Phase 2: System Architecture Enhancement (In Progress)
- Analyzed current implementation and identified improvement opportunities
- Developed plan for hierarchical process flow with Game Director Agent
- Designed approach for planning capabilities and iterative refinement
- Created strategy for standardized output formats for different content types
- Documented architecture enhancements in space_hulk_system_improvements.md

## Technical Decisions

1. **Task Validation Approach**: Removed unnecessary task validation that relied on non-existent decorators (`before_task` and `after_task`), as deterministic validation of AI-generated outputs isn't suitable.

2. **Error Recovery**: Maintained task-specific error recovery mechanisms to provide fallback content when tasks fail.

3. **Testing Strategy**: Focused testing on structural elements (input preparation, error handling, output processing) rather than deterministic content validation.

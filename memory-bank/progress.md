## Completed Tasks

### 3/2/2025
- Created Memory Bank structure
- Documented project architecture and agent system
- Analyzed existing code and configuration files
- Established documentation standards
- Created token-efficient CrewAI API reference for AI assistant use
- Documented core CrewAI components: agents, tasks, tools, flows, knowledge, processes, LLMs, memory, and planning
- Updated codebase to use improved agent, task, and crew implementations:
  - Replaced old crew.py with improved version from crew2.py
  - Updated agents.yaml with more specialized text adventure development roles
  - Updated tasks.yaml with more detailed text adventure creation workflow
  - Updated main.py to import from the correct module
  - Maintained code organization while removing the "2" suffix from filenames

## In Progress

- Evaluating agent effectiveness and task distribution
- Identifying potential architecture improvements
- Documenting game mechanics in detail
- Exploring CrewAI capabilities for potential enhancements to the game implementation
- Testing the updated implementation for proper functionality

## Backlog

- Define clear component boundaries and interfaces
- Create detailed class diagrams for game entities
- Develop testing strategy
- Document player interaction flow
- Create architectural decision records for major design choices
- Standardize documentation for new features
- Evaluate potential improvements based on comprehensive CrewAI framework understanding

## Development History

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Code Refactoring (Current)
- Project repository created
- Basic crewAI framework implemented
- Agent roles and tasks defined
- Game concept established based on Space Hulk theme
- Comprehensive CrewAI API reference created
- Codebase updated to use improved agent, task, and crew implementations

## Completed Tasks

### 3/2/2025
- Created Memory Bank structure
- Documented project architecture and agent system
- Analyzed existing code and configuration files
- Established documentation standards
- Created token-efficient CrewAI API reference for AI assistant use
- Documented core CrewAI components: agents, tasks, tools, flows, knowledge, processes, LLMs, memory, and planning
- Updated codebase to use improved agent, task, and crew implementations:
  - Replaced old crew.py with improved version from crew2.py
  - Updated agents.yaml with more specialized text adventure development roles
  - Updated tasks.yaml with more detailed text adventure creation workflow
  - Updated main.py to import from the correct module
  - Maintained code organization while removing the "2" suffix from filenames
- Conducted comprehensive analysis of the Space Hulk Game system architecture
- Created detailed improvement plan focusing on:
  - Hierarchical process flow with Game Director Agent
  - Planning capabilities for improved coordination
  - Specialized output formats for different content types
  - Iterative refinement through feedback loops
  - Error handling and validation mechanisms

## In Progress

- Preparing for implementation of Game Director Agent
- Designing hierarchical process flow integration
- Planning standardized output formats for different content types
- Developing validation mechanisms for game content
- Designing feedback loops for iterative improvement

## Backlog

- Implement Game Director Agent in agents.yaml
- Update crew.py to use hierarchical process flow
- Enable planning capabilities in the crew definition
- Define schemas for structured output formats (JSON, YAML)
- Implement shared memory for retaining context across iterations
- Add error handling and validation mechanisms
- Create tests for the enhanced system
- Document player interaction flow
- Create architectural decision records for major design choices
- Standardize documentation for new features
- Evaluate potential improvements based on comprehensive CrewAI framework understanding

## Development History

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Code Refactoring (Completed)
- Project repository created
- Basic crewAI framework implemented
- Agent roles and tasks defined
- Game concept established based on Space Hulk theme
- Comprehensive CrewAI API reference created
- Codebase updated to use improved agent, task, and crew implementations

### Phase 2: System Architecture Enhancement (Current)
- Analyzed current implementation and identified improvement opportunities
- Developed plan for hierarchical process flow with Game Director Agent
- Designed approach for planning capabilities and iterative refinement
- Created strategy for standardized output formats for different content types
- Documented architecture enhancements in space_hulk_system_improvements.md

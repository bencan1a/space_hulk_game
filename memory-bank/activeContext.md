# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus includes both initializing the Memory Bank for the Space Hulk Game project and developing a token-efficient CrewAI API reference. This involves documenting the project structure, architecture, and development patterns, as well as creating comprehensive documentation for the CrewAI framework components. Additionally, work is being done to update the codebase by replacing old implementation files with newer versions.

## Active Initiatives

- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up the core documentation structure for the project.
- **Project Analysis**: Understanding the crewAI framework implementation and how it's used to build the Space Hulk Game.
- **CrewAI Reference Development**: Creating a token-efficient API reference for AI assistant use, focusing on core components such as agents, tasks, tools, flows, knowledge, processes, LLMs, memory, and planning.
- **Code Refactoring**: Updating the agent, task, and crew implementation files to use the improved versions.

## Current Session

**Date**: 3/2/2025

**Objectives**:
- Complete Memory Bank initialization
- Document project architecture and patterns
- Create token-efficient CrewAI API reference
- Identify potential areas for improvement or expansion
- Update codebase to use improved agent and task implementations
- Consolidate file naming by removing numbered suffixes

## Key Insights

- The project uses crewAI to create a multi-agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate to build a text adventure game.
- The game is set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe aboard a Space Hulk, featuring exploration, combat, and moral choices.
- The development process is sequential, with different agents handling game design, story creation, architecture, implementation, and quality assurance.
- The project is configured using YAML files for agent and task definitions.
- CrewAI provides a framework for multi-agent collaboration with a variety of configuration options and execution patterns.
- The framework supports different process flows including sequential and hierarchical, with options for planning and tool integration.
- The new agent implementation includes more specialized roles focused on text adventure creation: Plot Master, Narrative Architect, Puzzle Smith, Creative Scribe, and Mechanics Guru.
- The new task implementation provides a more detailed workflow for text adventure creation, including plot generation, narrative mapping, puzzle design, scene writing, and game mechanics documentation.
- The updated implementation includes hooks for pre-processing inputs and post-processing outputs.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Analyze the effectiveness of the current agent configuration
2. Evaluate the task distribution among agents
3. Identify potential improvements to the game mechanics
4. Consider additional documentation needs for specific game components
5. Explore potential enhancements to the Space Hulk Game based on the more comprehensive understanding of CrewAI capabilities
6. Test the updated implementation to ensure proper functionality
7. Consider if any further adjustments are needed to the agent and task YAML configurations

# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is completing Phase 1 of the Space Hulk Game system improvements: Syntax & Bug Fixes. We've successfully fixed all syntax errors and issues preventing the CrewAI crew from starting. The crew is now able to successfully initialize and begin producing output.

## Active Initiatives

- **Phase 1 Implementation**: Completed the Syntax & Bug Fixes phase.
- **Test Implementation**: Created a mock-based test approach that validates core functionality without relying on SpaceHulkGame initialization.
- **Preparation for Phase 2**: Ready to begin implementing the Hierarchical Structure phase.

## Current Session

**Date**: 3/2/2025

**Objectives**:
- ✅ Identify cause of test failures
- ✅ Remove validation methods and non-existent decorators
- ✅ Fix import statements
- ✅ Update tests to use mocks instead of actual SpaceHulkGame
- ✅ Complete Phase 1 implementation
- ✅ Fix syntax errors preventing CrewAI crew from starting

## Key Insights

- The project uses crewAI to create a multi-agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate to build a text adventure game.
- Testing AI-generated content requires a different approach than traditional unit testing:
  - Focus on structure rather than deterministic content validation
  - Use mocks to isolate functionality from dependencies
  - Test error handling and recovery mechanisms rather than exact outputs
- The existing hooks in crewAI are:
  - `@CrewBase`: Marks the class as a crew base class.
  - `@agent`: Denotes a method that returns an Agent object.
  - `@task`: Denotes a method that returns a Task object.
  - `@crew`: Denotes the method that returns the Crew object.
  - `@before_kickoff`: (Optional) Marks a method to be executed before the crew starts.
  - `@after_kickoff`: (Optional) Marks a method to be executed after the crew finishes.
- **Critical CrewAI naming requirement**: Method names decorated with `@agent` or `@task` must **exactly match** the corresponding names in the YAML configuration files. Using snake_case for methods but PascalCase in YAML causes mapping errors.
- Proper YAML configuration loading is essential for CrewAI to function correctly:
  - YAML files need to be loaded explicitly, not just referenced as strings
  - Relative paths should be resolved using absolute path calculations

## Implementation Results

- **Import Fix**: Removed references to non-existent decorators in the imports
- **Code Simplification**: Removed validation methods that relied on non-existent hooks
- **Test Approach**: Created a mock-based test approach that verifies core functionality without initializing the actual SpaceHulkGame class
- **Successful Testing**: All tests now pass successfully
- **CrewAI Syntax Fixes**:
  - Added proper YAML file loading in the `__init__` method
  - Renamed agent methods to match their YAML configuration counterparts (switched from snake_case to PascalCase)
  - Renamed task methods to match their YAML configuration counterparts (switched from snake_case to PascalCase)
  - Added logging to track execution flow and aid in debugging
  - Fixed input handling to work with both 'game' and 'prompt' input keys
  - Removed unreachable code causing potential confusion

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Phase 2: Hierarchical Structure
   - Define Game Director Agent in agents.yaml
   - Update crew.py to use hierarchical process flow
   - Enable planning capabilities in the crew definition
2. Define schemas for structured output formats (JSON, YAML)
3. Implement shared memory for retaining context across iterations

# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is implementing Phase 2 of the Space Hulk Game system improvements: Narrative-Driven Hierarchical Structure. We've successfully converted the sequential process flow into a narrative-driven hierarchical structure with the Narrative Director Agent as the central coordinator.

## Active Initiatives

- **Phase 2 Implementation**: Successfully implemented the Narrative-Driven Hierarchical Structure phase:
  - Added Narrative Director Agent to coordinate the development process
  - Created narrative integration checkpoints to ensure narrative cohesion 
  - Established strict sequential dependencies through task configuration
  - Enabled planning capabilities in the crew definition
  - Implemented shared memory for context retention across agents
- **Preparation for Phase 3**: Ready to begin planning for the Planning Mechanism Integration phase.

## Current Session

**Date**: 3/2/2025

**Objectives**:
- ✅ Identify cause of test failures
- ✅ Remove validation methods and non-existent decorators
- ✅ Fix import statements
- ✅ Update tests to use mocks instead of actual SpaceHulkGame
- ✅ Complete Phase 1 implementation
- ✅ Fix syntax errors preventing CrewAI crew from starting
  - ✅ Fixed incorrect memory implementation (replaced `SharedMemory` with mem0 integration)
  - ✅ Fixed hierarchical process configuration issues:
    - Added required manager_agent parameter (NarrativeDirectorAgent)
    - Restored Process.hierarchical as specified in the implementation plan
    - Excluded manager agent from regular agents list to avoid validation error
    - Kept mem0 memory implementation for enhanced capabilities
  - ✅ Fixed multiple task dependency validation issues in tasks.yaml:
    - Removed problematic context dependencies from CreateNarrativeMap
    - Applied similar fixes to DesignArtifactsAndPuzzles, WriteSceneDescriptionsAndDialogue, and CreateGameMechanicsPRD
    - Kept execution dependencies intact to maintain proper task order
    - Added comments in the code explaining the changes
  - ✅ Identified OpenAI API key requirement:
    - CrewAI needs an OpenAI API key for LLM operations
    - API key can be provided via OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
    - Documented API key requirement in decisionLog.md
  - ✅ Fixed Ollama model integration:
    - Updated environment variables in .env file to use OpenAI-formatted names
    - Changed `MODEL` to `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`
    - Changed `API_BASE` to `OPENAI_API_BASE`
    - Added `OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy-value` (required by CrewAI/LiteLLM even for Ollama)
    - Implemented explicit LLM configuration for all agents:
      - Added import for `LLM` class
      - Created an explicit LLM instance in the `__init__` method
      - Added the LLM parameter to all agent creation methods
      - Re-enabled memory configuration in the crew definition
- ✅ Create detailed implementation plan for Phase 2
- ✅ Implement Phase 2: Narrative-Driven Hierarchical Structure
  - ✅ Add Narrative Director Agent to agents.yaml
  - ✅ Update tasks.yaml with narrative-driven structure and dependencies
  - ✅ Update crew.py to use hierarchical process flow
  - ✅ Add shared memory integration
  - ✅ Enable planning capabilities
- ⬜ Implement Phase 3: Planning Integration

## Key Insights

- The project uses crewAI to create a multi-agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate to build a text adventure game.
- Narrative cohesion is now the central pillar of the game development process:
  - Plot Master establishes a comprehensive narrative foundation before other work can proceed
  - Narrative Architect develops detailed story structure before specialized work can be fully effective
  - All specialists work with explicit narrative context provided by the Narrative Director
  - Regular integration checkpoints ensure all elements maintain narrative cohesion
- The hierarchical process flow creates a more resilient system with feedback loops:
  - The Narrative Director evaluates each component's narrative integration
  - Specialists receive specific feedback and can make revisions based on feedback
  - Final integration ensures a cohesive narrative experience
- CrewAI's shared memory allows information to be retained across agents and tasks
- CrewAI's planning capability allows agents to create strategic plans before executing tasks

## Implementation Results

- **Phase 1: Code & Syntax Fixes**:
  - Removed references to non-existent decorators in the imports
  - Removed validation methods that relied on non-existent hooks
  - Created a mock-based test approach that verifies core functionality
  - Added proper YAML file loading in the `__init__` method
  - Renamed agent and task methods to match their YAML configuration counterparts
  - Added logging to track execution flow and aid in debugging
  - Fixed input handling to work with both 'game' and 'prompt' input keys

- **Phase 2: Narrative-Driven Hierarchical Structure**:
  - Added NarrativeDirectorAgent to oversee the development process
  - Implemented strict sequential dependencies to ensure narrative foundations first
  - Added evaluation tasks to create feedback loops and integration checkpoints
  - Updated crew configuration to use hierarchical process flow
  - Implemented shared memory for context retention across all agents
  - Enabled planning capabilities for improved coordination

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Plan for Phase 3: Planning Integration
   - Define custom planning functions tailored to narrative-driven development
   - Implement metrics for evaluating narrative quality
   - Create planning templates for different game types
2. Test the Phase 2 implementation
   - Run with a simple game prompt to test the hierarchical workflow
   - Verify proper sequential dependencies and integration checkpoints
   - Confirm narrative cohesion across all game elements
3. Begin Phase 4 planning: Output Format Standardization

## Current Debugging

**Issue**: The CrewAI crew is failing to start due to syntax errors.

**First Syntax Error**:
- Error: ImportError: cannot import name 'SharedMemory' from 'crewai.memory'
- Location: src/space_hulk_game/crew.py, line 9
- Diagnosis: The 'SharedMemory' class doesn't exist in the current CrewAI version. According to the official documentation, CrewAI provides these memory classes instead:
  - ShortTermMemory: For temporary storage of recent interactions (using RAG)
  - LongTermMemory: For preserving insights from past executions
  - EntityMemory: For entity information
  
**Proposed Fix**:
1. Update the import statement to use the correct memory classes
2. Replace SharedMemory usage with the appropriate memory implementation (likely ShortTermMemory)
3. Update any references to shared_memory in agent initialization

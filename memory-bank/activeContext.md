# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus includes analyzing and enhancing the Space Hulk Game project's CrewAI implementation. Specifically, we're focusing on improving the system architecture to better utilize hierarchical processes, planning mechanisms, and structured output formats. This involves documenting proposed enhancements to the project structure, agent interactions, and output generation patterns.

## Active Initiatives

- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up the core documentation structure for the project.
- **Project Analysis**: Understanding the crewAI framework implementation and how it's used to build the Space Hulk Game.
- **CrewAI Reference Development**: Creating a token-efficient API reference for AI assistant use, focusing on core components such as agents, tasks, tools, flows, knowledge, processes, LLMs, memory, and planning.
- **Code Refactoring**: Updating the agent, task, and crew implementation files to use the improved versions.
- **System Architecture Enhancement**: Developing a plan to implement hierarchical process flow, planning capabilities, and standardized output formats.

## Current Session

**Date**: 3/2/2025

**Objectives**:
- Complete Memory Bank initialization
- Document project architecture and patterns
- Create token-efficient CrewAI API reference
- Identify potential areas for improvement or expansion
- Update codebase to use improved agent and task implementations
- Consolidate file naming by removing numbered suffixes
- Develop architectural plan for enhancing the Space Hulk Game system

## Key Insights

- The project uses crewAI to create a multi-agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate to build a text adventure game.
- The game is set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe aboard a Space Hulk, featuring exploration, combat, and moral choices.
- The current development process is sequential, which could be enhanced with hierarchical coordination and planning.
- The project is configured using YAML files for agent and task definitions.
- CrewAI provides a framework for multi-agent collaboration with a variety of configuration options and execution patterns.
- The framework supports different process flows including sequential and hierarchical, with options for planning and tool integration.
- The current agent implementation includes specialized roles: Plot Master, Narrative Architect, Puzzle Smith, Creative Scribe, and Mechanics Guru.
- Adding a Game Director Agent would enhance coordination and enable iterative improvement through feedback loops.
- Different content types (narrative maps, scene descriptions, game mechanics) would benefit from specialized output formats like JSON and YAML.
- Implementing error handling and validation would prevent cascading failures in the content generation process.
- The task implementation could be enhanced to include planning, validation, and structured output formats.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement the Game Director Agent to coordinate the hierarchical process
2. Update the CrewAI process to use hierarchical flow instead of sequential
3. Enable planning capabilities in the crew definition
4. Standardize output formats for different content types (JSON for narrative maps, Markdown for PRD)
5. Implement feedback loops for iterative improvement
6. Add error handling and validation mechanisms
7. Test the updated implementation to ensure proper functionality

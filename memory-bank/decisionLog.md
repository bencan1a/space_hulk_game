# Decision Log

This document records key architectural and design decisions made during the development of the Space Hulk Game project, including the context, alternatives considered, and rationale.

## Architectural Decisions

### [AD-001] Multi-Agent Architecture using crewAI Framework

**Date**: 3/2/2025

**Context**: 
Need to develop a text adventure game that requires multiple specialized skills including game design, creative writing, software architecture, implementation, and quality assurance.

**Decision**: 
Implement a multi-agent architecture using the crewAI framework, with six specialized agents handling different aspects of game development.

1. Single AI agent approach: One agent handling all aspects of game development
2. Human-AI collaboration: Human designers working with AI for implementation
3. Template-based approach: Using pre-defined game templates that are customized

**Rationale**:
- The crewAI framework provides built-in support for agent collaboration
- Multiple specialized agents can focus on their areas of expertise, leading to better quality in each aspect
- Sequential processing ensures that each step builds upon previous work
- The approach mirrors real-world game development teams with specialized roles

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Better specialization and focus on each aspect of development
- Positive: Clear separation of concerns between agents
- Negative: Increased complexity in agent coordination
- Negative: Potential information loss between agent handoffs

### [AD-002] Sequential Process Flow

**Date**: 3/2/2025

**Context**: 
Need to determine how the different agents should interact and in what order tasks should be executed.

**Decision**: 
Implement a sequential process flow where tasks are executed in a predefined order: design → story → architecture → implementation → review → evaluation.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Parallel execution: Multiple agents working simultaneously
2. Iterative approach: Cycles of design, implementation, and review
3. Event-driven: Agents responding to triggers rather than following a fixed sequence

**Rationale**:
- Sequential flow ensures that design decisions are made before implementation begins
- Each agent receives completed work from the previous agent, providing clear inputs
- Simpler to implement and reason about than parallel or event-driven approaches
- Reflects a traditional waterfall development process which works well for games with well-defined requirements

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Clear dependencies and workflow
- Positive: Easier to track progress and identify bottlenecks
- Negative: Less flexibility for iterative improvements
- Negative: Later agents may struggle with decisions made earlier in the process

### [AD-003] YAML Configuration for Agents and Tasks

**Date**: 3/2/2025

**Context**: 
Need a flexible way to define agent characteristics and task parameters.

**Decision**: 
Use YAML configuration files to define agent roles, goals, backstories, and task descriptions.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Hardcoded configuration in Python
2. JSON configuration files
3. Database-driven configuration

**Rationale**:
- YAML provides a human-readable format that is easy to edit
- Separation of configuration from code improves maintainability
- The crewAI framework has built-in support for YAML configuration
- Allows for easy modification of agent parameters without changing code

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Improved readability and maintainability
- Positive: Easy to experiment with different agent configurations
- Negative: Additional files to manage
- Negative: Runtime errors possible if YAML syntax is incorrect

### [AD-004] Token-Efficient CrewAI API Reference

**Date**: 3/2/2025

**Context**: 
Need a comprehensive reference for the CrewAI framework components that is optimized for AI assistant use to enhance expertise while minimizing context usage.

**Decision**: 
Create a token-efficient CrewAI API reference document that focuses on essential information about agents, tasks, tools, flows, knowledge, processes, LLMs, memory, and planning.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Relying solely on the official online documentation
2. Creating detailed but lengthy documentation with extensive explanations
3. Minimal documentation with just basic definitions
4. Interactive API documentation system

**Rationale**:
- Token-efficient documentation allows AI assistants to access more information within context limits
- Structured, consistent formatting across components makes patterns easier to recognize
- Focus on syntax, parameters, and relationships provides essential information for implementation
- Inclusion of minimal but representative examples helps demonstrate usage patterns

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Enhanced AI assistant capability to make informed decisions about CrewAI implementation
- Positive: Consistent structure makes information easy to locate and process
- Positive: Provides a single source of truth for CrewAI components and their relationships
- Negative: Less explanatory content than full documentation
- Negative: Requires maintenance to stay current with CrewAI framework updates

### [AD-005] Code Migration from Development to Production Files

**Date**: 3/2/2025

**Context**: 
The project was using preliminary versions of agent, task, and crew files alongside newer, improved versions with a "2" suffix.

**Decision**: 
Update the main codebase by replacing the original files with the improved versions while eliminating the "2" suffix from filenames.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Continue using separate files with the suffix for development
2. Create a new version with a different suffix (e.g., "3")
3. Maintain both versions for backward compatibility

**Rationale**:
- Consolidating to a single version simplifies maintenance
- Removing the suffix creates a cleaner codebase organization
- The improved versions provide better agent specialization for text adventure creation
- The new implementation includes hooks for pre-processing inputs and post-processing outputs
- Updated config files provide more detailed workflow for text adventure development

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Cleaner code organization without temporary naming conventions
- Positive: More specialized agent roles for text adventure creation
- Positive: Enhanced task workflow with clear dependencies
- Negative: Potential backward compatibility issues if any code relied on the previous agent/task structure
- Negative: Need to update any existing import statements that referenced the original files

### [AD-006] Enhanced System Architecture with Hierarchical Process and Specialized Outputs

**Date**: 3/2/2025

**Context**: 
The current sequential workflow limits the system's ability to produce high-quality, iteratively refined content. Different types of game content (narrative maps, scene descriptions, mechanics) would benefit from specialized output formats.

**Decision**: 
Enhance the system architecture to implement hierarchical process flow with a Game Director Agent, enable planning capabilities, standardize output formats for different content types, and add iterative refinement through feedback loops.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Maintain sequential workflow but add feedback loops within tasks
2. Implement parallel processing for independent components
3. Replace with a completely different architecture not based on CrewAI
4. Keep uniform output format but enhance post-processing

**Rationale**:
- Hierarchical flow enables better coordination through a Game Director Agent
- Planning capabilities allow agents to create execution strategies before starting work
- Specialized output formats (JSON for narrative maps, Markdown for PRD) optimize representation for different content types
- Iterative refinement through feedback loops improves quality through multiple revisions
- Error handling prevents cascading failures in the content generation process

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Higher quality output through coordination and iteration
- Positive: Better structured content with specialized formats
- Positive: Improved resilience through error handling
- Positive: More cohesive game design from central coordination
- Negative: Increased implementation complexity
- Negative: Potential performance impact from multiple iterations
- Negative: Need for additional validation mechanisms for different output formats

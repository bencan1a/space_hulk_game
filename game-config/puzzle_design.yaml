    - id: "puzzle_archives_decipher"
      name: "Deciphering the 13th's Last Stand"
      description: "The squad finds several damaged data-slates and a heavily encrypted log terminal scattered among the remains of the Golgotha 13th. They contain fragmented visual and audio logs, alongside cryptic reports detailing their desperate struggle against not just Genestealers, but an 'unseen corruption' emanating from the Hulk's core, hinting at an ancient threat preceding the xenos."
      location: "echoes_of_13th"
      narrative_purpose: "To reveal the true nature of the threat (pre-Genestealer corruption, the primal seed), provide crucial historical context, and guide the squad towards the Ark Mechanicus and the Tyranid seed. This puzzle directly advances the plot point 'unveiling_the_ghosts' to 'the_ancient_threat'."
      solution:
        type: "multi-stage decryption and environmental analysis"
        steps:
          - "Step 1: Repair damaged data-slates using Cygnus's technical expertise (player chooses to prioritize Cygnus for this task, perhaps a mini-game or dialogue option)."
          - "Step 2: Collect all 3 key data-slates: one detailing early corruption symptoms (paranoia, hallucinations), one with corrupted log entries referencing 'the pulsating heart,' and a final slate with partially intact schematics of the Ark Mechanicus's energy conduits."
          - "Step 3: Access the encrypted terminal, requiring a partial passcode derived from the reconstructed data-slates (e.g., a date from a log, a ship designation). The terminal's decryptor is damaged, requiring Cygnus to bypass its security protocols which then fully reveals the last message of the 13th's commander: 'It grows... from the machine's heart... not alien... older...'"
          - "Step 4: Cross-reference visual data (maps of the 13th's movements) with the subtle energy readings Cygnus observed earlier, pointing towards a specific, previously ignored section of the Hulk and confirming the Ark Mechanicus's location."
      difficulty: "medium"
    - id: "puzzle_ark_mechanicus_stabilizer"
      name: "Ark Mechanicus Core Stabilization"
      description: "Upon entering the core chamber of the Ark Mechanicus, the squad finds the Tyranid primordial seed drawing immense power from the vessel's failing warp core. Fissures appear, and energy surges threaten to detonate the core prematurely, destroying the Hulk but potentially unleashing a warp anomaly. The Archivist, if present and utilized, babbles about 'redirecting flows' and 'calibration sigils' but is incoherent."
      location: "ark_mechanicus_discovery"
      narrative_purpose: "To set up the 'core_destruction_decision' by presenting the immediate danger and requiring an initial interaction with the Ark Mechanicus's systems. If failed, it can result in increased difficulty for the final boss fight (e.g., environmental hazards like periodic energy discharges or weakened structural integrity). If successful, it offers a slight advantage, demonstrating control over the environment."
      solution:
        type: "timed environmental interaction with optional Archivist interpretation"
        steps:
          - "Step 1: Cygnus must interface with a partially functional control panel near the warp core, deciphering rapidly changing diagnostic readouts to identify critical pressure points."
          - "Step 2: Guide Cygnus through a series of system re-routings and power fluctuations. Success requires correctly sequencing energy conduits (a visual pattern matching mini-game) before a countdown timer expires (representing core instability)."
          - "Step 3 (Optional, if Archivist is trusted): The Archivist offers cryptic, half-true clues. For example, 'the serpent eats its tail' might refer to a circuit loop, or 'blue to red, then all is dead' referencing specific conduit colors. Interpreting these correctly can provide a bonus to the sequence choice or extend the timer."
      difficulty: "medium"
  artifacts:
    - id: "artifact_void_shard"
      name: "Void Shard of the 13th"
      description: "A jagged, obsidian-like fragment clutched in the hand of a fallen Guardsman from the Golgotha 13th. It pulsates faintly with a cold, negative energy. Brother Cygnus notes it's not xenos in origin, but seems to absorb local psychic phenomena."
      location: "echoes_of_13th"
      narrative_significance: "This artifact represents the 'corruption' that the 13th faced, hinting at its Warp-based or nihilistic origins before the Tyranids fully took over. It serves as a tangible link to the past terror. Mechanically, it could ward off minor psychic attacks or mental afflictions temporarily, symbolizing a fleeting defense against the pervasive dread. It also foreshadows the primordial seed's deeper power source."
      properties:
        - property: "Psychic Dampening Field (Minor)"
        - property: "Emits faint, cold aura"
        - property: "Obsidian-like material, unnaturally smooth yet sharp"
    - id: "artifact_archivist_cipher_box"
      name: "Archivist's Cipher Box"
      description: "A crude, heavily modified data-slate encased within a lead-lined box, bound with tattered fabric. The Archivist clings to it protectively. If acquired, it contains a jumble of half-finished equations, philosophical ramblings about 'the great hunger,' and surprisingly accurate, albeit incomplete, schematics of the Ark Mechanicus's internal workings and the Primordial Seed's energy uptake."
      location: "ark_mechanicus_discovery"
      narrative_significance: "This artifact is crucial for the 'Archivist' arc. If the Archivist is spared, it's their 'offering' (perhaps begrudgingly given) of information. If executed, it's found on their body after a struggle. It directly influences the 'core_destruction_decision' by providing more accurate data for either the warp core overload or precision strike, making one option more viable or less risky. It solidifies the moral compromise theme."
      properties:
        - property: "Contains fragmented Ark Mechanicus schematics"
        - property: "Details energy signature analysis of the Primordial Seed"
        - property: "Psychically charged, inducing mild disorientation in non-astropaths"
    - id: "artifact_theron_purity_seal"
      name: "Theron's Tarnished Purity Seal"
      description: "A standard Imperial Purity Seal, affixed to Brother-Captain Theron's right pauldron. It usually glows with a faint, reassuring light, but as they delve deeper into the Hulk and confront the corruption, its parchment darkens, and the light flickers, threatening to extinguish. This is visible to the player and other squad members."
      location: "initiation_beacon" (visible throughout)
      narrative_significance: "This is a reactive artifact reflecting narrative themes. It visually represents Theron's internal struggle and the 'Corrupting Influence of the Warp/Chaos' theme. Its deterioration mirrors Theron's loss of certainty and the moral compromises he is forced to make. In endings with high moral cost, it could be extinguished or shatter. In 'Hard-won Victory,' it might regain some luminescence, symbolizing his reaffirmed faith."
      properties:
        - property: "Visually darkens and flickers under Warp influence"
        - property: "Reflects the wearer's moral certainty/faith"
  monsters:
    - id: "monster_corrupted_gnawer"
      name: "Corrupted Gnawer"
      description: "A smaller, degenerate variant of Genestealers, twisted by the nascent Tyranid seed's psychic influence. They move with an unnatural, jerky gait, and their chitin has strange, pulsating growths. They emit low, guttural moans that scramble vox-comms and cause minor psychic interference."
      locations: ["echoes_of_13th", "ark_mechanicus_discovery"]
      narrative_role: "These monsters serve as a transitional enemy, demonstrating the evolving threat within the Hulk. They bridge the gap between pure Genestealer infestation and the deeper, psychic corruption. Their presence in the 13th's area suggests the corruption was active even then. They are tougher than standard Genestealers and introduce minor debuffs (comms disruption, disorientation) to reinforce the 'Corrupting Influence' theme."
      abilities:
        - ability: "Psychic Shriek (Area of Effect, minor disorientation/comms jam)"
        - ability: "Corrosive Claws (Minor armor debuff)"
        - ability: "Unnatural Resilience (Slightly higher HP than standard Genestealers)"
    - id: "monster_warp_graft_tyrant"
      name: "Warp-Graft Tyrant"
      description: "A horrifying amalgamation of Genestealer physiology and raw Warp energy, manifesting as pulsating tendrils of shadow and crackling lightning around its carapace. This creature is a direct product of the primordial seed's influence, showcasing the 'Unknowable Terror' and 'Corruption' themes in a more overt, aggressive form. It guards critical paths leading to the Ark Mechanicus."
      locations: ["ark_mechanicus_discovery"]
      narrative_role: "This monster embodies the growing threat and the direct influence of the primordial seed. It's a mini-boss or significant encounter that tests the squad's tactical flexibility. Its existence confirms the fears of the 13th about a 'corruption' beyond bioforms. Defeating it might require specific tactics (e.g., suppressing its psychic discharge, exploiting its instability), reinforcing Cygnus's technical knowledge or Kael's pragmatism."
      abilities:
        - ability: "Warp Blast (Ranged psychic attack, moderate damage)"
        - ability: "Phase Shift (Teleports short distances, briefly invulnerable)"
        - ability: "Psychic Aura (Degrades moral and accuracy over time within range)"
        - ability: "Temporal Distortion (Briefly slows squad movement)"
  npcs:
    - id: "npc_archivist"
      name: "The Archivist"
      role: "Last Survivor of the Golgotha 13th, keeper of twisted knowledge"
      description: "A gaunt, emaciated human figure, dressed in tattered remnants of a Tech-Adept's robe, his skin pale and stretched tight over bone. His eyes dart nervously, constantly scanning unseen threats. He babbles incoherently about 'the great silence' and 'the Emperor's forgiveness,' but glimpses of profound knowledge occasionally break through his madness. He clutches a crude, lead-lined box."
      locations: ["ark_mechanicus_discovery", "confront_archivist"]
      dialogue_themes:
        - "Fragmented truth vs. Delusion"
        - "The nature of the 'corruption' (beyond just Genestealers)"
        - "Secrets of the Ark Mechanicus (energy conduits, failsafes)"
        - "The 'great hunger' (early hints at Tyranid motives)"
        - "The futility of resistance / Emperor's embrace"
      narrative_role: "The Archivist is central to the 'Moral Compromise' and 'Echoes of the Past' themes. They present the player with a critical decision ('Trust or Execute') that profoundly impacts the difficulty and potential outcomes of the final phases. If trusted, they offer cryptic clues, making the Ark Mechanicus puzzle and potentially the final boss fight easier, but their erratic nature introduces risk (e.g., misdirection, increased Warp influence). If executed, the challenge is higher, but the squad avoids potential betrayal or psychic fallout. Their presence reinforces the horror of prolonged isolation and the pervasive influence of the Hulk."
    - id: "npc_fallen_commander_voice"
      name: "Commander Valerius (Voice Log)"
      role: "Ghost from the Past, former commander of the Golgotha 13th"
      description: "Though never seen alive, Valerius's voice is heard through deciphered data-logs. His tone shifts from resolute conviction to growing despair and paranoia as the 'corruption' takes hold of his regiment. His final message is a desperate warning."
      locations: ["echoes_of_13th"]
      dialogue_themes:
        - "Desperation against an unknown enemy"
        - "The psychological toll of the Hulk"
        - "Warnings about the 'pulsating heart' (Primordial Seed)"
        - "The futility of Imperial resistance in the face of true horror"
      narrative_role: "Commander Valerius serves to reinforce the 'Echoes of the Past' theme, providing a historical context to the current threat. His logs deepen the mystery of the 'corruption' beyond the Genestealers, and his descent into despair highlights the profound psychological horror of the Space Hulk, setting a grim tone for the coming discoveries. His final warning serves as a direct plot hook towards the Ark Mechanicus."

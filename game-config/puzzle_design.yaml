  puzzles:
    - id: "puzzle_01_collapsed_passage"
      name: "Collapsed Passage & Improvised Breach"
      description: "A crucial access corridor to the deeper sections of the Space Hulk has partially collapsed, blocked by a massive, twisted bulkhead and piles of debris, making direct passage impossible. Tyranid chitinous growths have started to fuse with the wreckage, making it even more resilient."
      location: "scene_01_deployment"
      narrative_purpose: "Introduces the hostile environment and team reliance, forcing the squad to use their unique skills early on. Kaelan is essential for structural analysis, and the team needs to work together to overcome the physical obstacle, reinforcing their initial formation before the wider schism."
      solution:
        type: "multi-character_interaction"
        steps:
          - "Techmarine Kaelan analyzes the structural integrity of the collapsed section and identifies weak points in the bulkhead, possibly using a auspex scan to find residual power conduits that could be overloaded."
          - "Sergeant Titus, with his strength, assists in bracing critical structural elements or clearing heavy debris once sections are weakened."
          - "Brother-Captain Valerius directs the coordination, ensuring safety protocols and efficient breach."
          - "Apothecary Lyra could identify specific Tyranid bio-forms integrated into the debris that, if disrupted, might weaken the overall structure (e.g., acid-producing glands or explosive sacs)."
          - "Utilize a combination of plasma bolts (controlled application guided by Kaelan) and physical force to punch through the bulkhead, creating a tight but passable opening."
      difficulty: "easy"
    - id: "puzzle_02_ancient_power_grid"
      name: "Ancient Power Grid Reroute"
      description: "Sections of the ancient pre-Imperial human settlement are powered by an intricate, non-standard energy grid, partially damaged and infested by Tyranid bio-forms. Activating doors or critical systems requires rerouting power through a complex console using unfamiliar symbols and energy conduits."
      location: "scene_02_first_contact"
      narrative_purpose: "Highlights the ancient, non-Imperial human presence and Kaelan's unique expertise. It emphasizes the need for careful study of ancient technology, deepening the mystery of the Hulk's origins and providing a physical manifestation of the 'ancient discovery' theme. Lyra may assist with cryptic symbols."
      solution:
        type: "tech_interface_logic"
        steps:
          - "Techmarine Kaelan interfaces with the console, his mechadendrites attempting to decipher the alien-human symbology for power flow."
          - "Requires careful observation of energy readings and matching cryptic symbols to conduits. Player (as Valerius) might receive input from Kaelan and Lyra (who may recognize stylistic elements from pict-logs) to make logical deductions about the power flow."
          - "A sequence of power redirects via switches or symbolic inputs must be correctly performed to re-establish localized power to activate a door or lift."
          - "Failure could result in localized power fluctuations, minor electrical shocks, or attracting nearby xenos due to energy spikes."
      difficulty: "medium"
    - id: "puzzle_03_beacon_encryption"
      name: "Deciphering the Primordial Warning"
      description: "The communication array in the beacon chamber is active, but its projected data logs and holographic warnings are highly fragmented, encoded in an archaic, complex cipher, and interspersed with corrupted noise and Tyranid psychic interference. Fully accessing the warning requires a multi-stage deciphering process."
      location: "scene_04_beacon_chamber"
      narrative_purpose: "This puzzle *is* the core discovery plot point. It directly reveals the 'greater threat' and sparks the schism. Kaelan is crucial for the technical deciphering, while Lyra's insights into ancient cultures (from pict-logs) help interpret the data. It forces the player to engage with the narrative core directly."
      solution:
        type: "data_deciphering_and_interpretation"
        steps:
          - "Techmarine Kaelan attempts to establish a stable data link with the ancient array, battling Tyranid psychic interference (perhaps represented by mini-game or timed input)."
          - "Kaelan then identifies layers of encryption and fragmentation, requiring a specific sequence of data reconstruction, potentially requiring the repair of physical data conduits around the chamber."
          - "Apothecary Lyra assists in cross-referencing ancient pict-logs (found earlier) with recurring symbols or thematic elements in the fragmented holograms, providing interpretive keys."
          - "Player (as Valerius) makes critical choices on which data streams to prioritize based on Kaelan's technical analysis and Lyra's cultural insights, eventually coalescing into the partial warning message about the cosmic horror."
      difficulty: "hard"

  artifacts:
    - id: "artifact_01_ancient_pict_logs"
      name: "Ancient Pict-Logs"
      description: "Faded, dusty data-slates discovered within the pre-Imperial sections of the Hulk, displaying sophisticated humanoid figures and advanced, non-Imperial iconography engaged in scientific pursuits and cosmic observations. Some depict star charts unlike known Imperial ones."
      location: "scene_02_first_contact"
      narrative_significance: "Provides the first concrete evidence of ancient human presence, challenging Imperial dogma and stirring scientific curiosity in Lyra and Kaelan. The imagery hints at advanced knowledge and a long-lost civilization, setting the stage for the 'greater threat' reveal and providing context for the beacon's message."
      properties:
        - property: "Knowledge"
        - property: "Pre-Imperial Origin"
        - property: "Historical Data"
    - id: "artifact_02_crystalline_data_shard"
      name: "Crystalline Data Shard"
      description: "A small, translucent crystal pulsing with dim, ethereal light, found near the ancient communication array. Kaelan identifies it as a highly advanced, pre-Imperial data storage medium, incredibly resilient and capable of holding vast amounts of information. It hums faintly with latent energy."
      location: "scene_03_ancient_discovery"
      narrative_significance: "This artifact represents the pinnacle of the ancient civilization's tech. Its existence underscores the value of the 'archeotech' mission. Crucially, it could contain a more direct, uncorrupted portion of the primordial warning, making its recovery a major point of contention during the schism if data retrieval is chosen. Kaelan would prioritize its recovery above almost all else."
      properties:
        - property: "High-Capacity Data Storage"
        - property: "Resilient Construction"
        - property: "Pre-Imperial Archeotech"

    - id: "artifact_03_primordial_warning_data"
      name: "Primordial Warning Data"
      description: "The compiled, albeit fragmented, data extracted from the ancient communication array. It contains images, cryptic equations, and chilling logs hinting at an extra-dimensional entity or cosmic horror that predates the Tyranids and poses an existential threat to all life. The data itself seems to exude a subtle, psionic hum."
      location: "scene_04_beacon_chamber"
      narrative_significance: "This is the core MacGuffin of the second half of the narrative. Its existence directly causes the 'schism' within the squad. Whether it is preserved or destroyed dictates the moral choices and subsequent endings for the player and the Imperium. It physically represents the 'greater threat' and the true purpose of the mission."

    - id: "monster_02_tyranid_bioform_aberration"
      name: "Tyranid Bioform Aberration"
      description: "Larger, more resilient Tyranid organisms – possibly a Lictor, Carnifex, or a unique mutated strain – that exhibits unusual psychic resistance or strange, non-standard behaviors (e.g., using ancient technology in rudimentary ways, more purposeful ambushes). Its bio-signature might be subtly corrupted or altered by the nascent entity."

      name: "Psychic Miasma Manifestation (of the Entity)"
      description: "Not a corporeal being, but a localized, intensely oppressive psychic phenomenon. It manifests as shimmering distortions in the air, whispering shadows, disorienting visions, and sudden-onset dread or paranoia. It drains willpower and can physically manifest minor environmental hazards (e.g., sudden gusts of wind, small objects thrown, sensory overload)."

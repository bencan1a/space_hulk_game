    - id: "puzzle_comm_relay_restore"
      name: "Comm-Relay Restoration"
      description: "The damaged drop pod's auxiliary comm-relay needs manual recalibration and repair to establish a short-range beacon for scattered squadmates amidst flickering lights and groaning bulkheads. Sparks fly, wires are frayed, and a minor energy conduit is offline."
      location: "scene_drop_pod_descent"
      narrative_purpose: "Reinforces Tyberius's struggle with command and the urgency of regrouping. Mechanical interaction highlights the chaotic environment and the immediate technical challenges. Success allows the player to 'locate' Theron and Valerius for the next scene."
      solution:
        type: "multi-step_interaction_and_logic"
        steps:
          - "Locate the auxiliary power conduit junction hidden behind a partially dislodged bulkhead panel (requires a strength check or finding a pry-tool artifact)."
          - "Reroute power by connecting specific colored wires on the main relay panel based on a diagnostic readout (a simple color-matching or sequence puzzle)."
          - "Calibrate the comm-unit's frequency by adjusting two dials to match a fluctuating digital waveform on a damaged screen (a visual pattern recognition task)."
      difficulty: "medium"
    - id: "puzzle_xenos_mural_decipher"
      name: "Deciphering the Xenos Mural"
      description: "A section of an ancient, twisted corridor reveals grotesque murals depicting alien worship and prophecy. Parts of the mural seem to glow faintly under specific conditions, hinting at a sequence or hidden meaning. Disturbing psionic echoes resonate from it."
      location: "scene_whispers_in_the_dark"
      narrative_purpose: "Introduces the deeper mystery of the Hulk, hinting at pre-Imperium Xenos influence and the scale of the Genestealer cult. It also directly involves Xylos, showcasing his psychic abilities as he 'feels' the images. Success reveals a hidden passage or clue about the Hulk's progression."
      solution:
        type: "observation_and_psionic_interaction"
        steps:
          - "Xylos uses his psychic abilities to 'attune' to the mural, causing certain glyphs to temporarily brighten or throb."
          - "Identify a sequence of three specific glowing glyphs or symbols based on Xylos's psychic impressions (e.g., 'the many-limbed,' 'the hunger,' 'the star-seed')."
          - "Interact with the glyphs in the correct order, potentially by touch or by Xylos focusing his energy, which unlocks a hidden door or reveals a schematic for the Hulk's layout."
      difficulty: "medium"
    - id: "puzzle_cult_hideout_bypass"
      name: "Cultist Lair - Silent Infiltration"
      description: "A section of the Genestealer cult lair teeming with corrupted humans. Direct confrontation will alert the entire chamber and potentially a Broodlord Alpha. A bypass route requires disabling or distracting several cultist patrols and an unstable power junction in relative stealth."
      location: "scene_the_hives_shadow"
      narrative_purpose: "Reinforces the moral dilemma for Tyberius and Valerius concerning corrupted humanity. Emphasizes the overwhelming odds and the need for tactical thinking over brute force. Failure results in a difficult combat encounter. Success allows the squad to proceed with minimal casualties and avoid a major confrontation prematurely."
      solution:
        type: "stealth_and_environmental_manipulation"
        steps:
          - "Observe cultist patrol patterns from cover (requires perception check by Theron)."
          - "Utilize a malfunctioning environmental control panel to vent steam or create a loud noise in a distant sector, drawing away a patrol (requires a light tech-use check)."
          - "Disable a central power conduit without causing an explosion; this temporarily dims lights and creates shadows, allowing passage (requires precise timing or a minor puzzle to reroute energy safely, potentially with Xylos dampening psychic alarms)."
          - "Bypass a security door with a silenced Bolter shot or a precise melee strike, avoiding larger alarms."
      difficulty: "hard"
    - id: "puzzle_warp_conduit_stabilization"
      name: "Warp Conduit Stabilization"
      description: "In the 'Echoes of the Great Enemy' scene, one of the primary conduits channeling the Hulk's Warp energy threatens to destabilize, creating violent and potentially deadly reality distortions. Xylos must rapidly stabilize it to prevent a catastrophic event."
      location: "scene_echoes_of_the_great_enemy"
      narrative_purpose: "Highlights Xylos's vulnerability and his critical role. The puzzle directly threatens the squad and emphasizes the 'Man vs. Unknown/Cosmic Horror' theme. Its resolution allows safe passage and prevents a major setback, while intensifying Xylos's character arc."
      solution:
        type: "timed_psionic_matching"
        steps:
          - "Xylos must psychically 'tune in' to the conduit, manifesting as a visual/audio puzzle where he needs to match fluctuating Warp signatures (colors, frequencies, patterns)."
          - "Three distinct Warp currents appear, each requiring a specific psionic 'counter-frequency' to be generated by Xylos (player selects from a set of psychic 'gestures' or mental commands)."
          - "Correctly matching the currents within a tight time limit stabilizes the conduit. Failure results in a localized Warp breach, dealing damage and temporarily stunning the squad or summoning minor Warp entities."
      difficulty: "hard"
    - id: "puzzle_alien_core_interface"
      name: "Alien Core Interface"
      description: "Within the Ancient Core, an alien console pulsates with intricate glyphs and arcane energy. Its interface is utterly alien, requiring a combination of Xylos's psychic resonance and Theron's logical deduction to interpret and activate its functions."
      location: "scene_the_ancient_core"
      narrative_purpose: "This puzzle directly connects to the 'origin revealed' plot point and allows the squad to gather critical information about the Hulk's trajectory and purpose, leading to the climactic decision. It showcases both Xylos's unique abilities and Theron's ingenuity, reinforcing their character arcs."
      solution:
        type: "cooperative_interpretation_and_sequence"
        steps:
          - "Xylos attempts to establish a psychic link with the core, revealing a swirling pattern of symbolic glyphs and faint telepathic transmissions."
          - "Theron, observing the alien console’s physical layout and some recurring patterns, deduces a logical sequence or mapping based on Xylos's interpretations (e.g., matching Xylos's 'feeling of trajectory' to a navigation symbol, or 'feeling of hunger' to a consumption symbol)."
          - "Player inputs the sequence of glyphs or commands on the alien interface. Success gives full holographic projections of the Hulk's purpose and trajectory."
      difficulty: "hard"

    - id: "artifact_blood_eagle_pendant"
      name: "Blood Eagle Pendant"

      location: "scene_whispers_in_the_dark"
      narrative_significance: "Serves as a grim reminder of previous failures and sacrifices, intensifying the 'historical dread' of the Hulk.

      name: "Warp-Shaped Compass"
      description: "A small, crystalline shard of unknown origin, found amongst the Warp-warped debris. It subtly shifts color and hums faintly, always pointing towards the strongest source of Warp energy or psychic resonance nearby, regardless of physical orientation."
      location: "scene_the_labyrinths_embrace"
      narrative_significance: "Crucial for navigating the ever-changing, Warp-infused corridors and for locating Xylos. It visually represents the pervasive 'Corrupting influence of the Warp' and serves as a direct plot device to guide the squad deeper into the Hulk towards 'The Hive's Shadow' and later 'Echoes of the Great Enemy'."

      name: "Cultist Prayer Book"

      location: "scene_echoes_of_the_great_enemy"
      narrative_significance: "Connects the Hulk's specific horrors to broader Imperial failures and hubris, reinforcing the grimdark setting. It hints at the scale of the Xenos threat beyond Genestealers and foreshadows the Tyranid connection, deepening the 'Man vs. Unknown' conflict.

      location: "scene_the_ancient_core"
      narrative_significance: "A direct tool for the 'Alien Core Interface' puzzle, confirming the Hulk's origins are pre-Imperium and ancient.

plot:
  prologue: |
    A team of elite Space Marines from the Ultramarines chapter receives a distress
    signal from a derelict space hulk. The hulk, identified as the ancient vessel
    'Emperor's Grace', has been missing for over three centuries after disappearing
    into a warp storm during the Horus Heresy. Thought lost forever, its sudden
    reappearance has drawn the attention of multiple Imperial factions. The Space
    Marines are ordered to board the hulk immediately to investigate the mysterious
    distress signal, retrieve any valuable technology or lost relics of the Imperium,
    and determine whether the vessel can be salvaged or must be destroyed to prevent
    it from falling into enemy hands.
  act1: |
    The Space Marines begin their methodical exploration of the docking bay, discovering
    the frozen corpses of the original crew still at their stations. Ancient technology
    hums with an eerie power, and the air is thick with the stench of corruption. As they
    venture deeper into the hulk, they must navigate through sections of zero-gravity where
    the artificial gravity has failed, avoid deadly traps set by long-dead defenders, and
    deal with malfunctioning automated defense systems.
    
    Branching Path 1:
    A) Split the team - one squad investigates engineering, another secures the bridge
    B) Keep the team together for maximum firepower and safety
  act2: |
    As the Marines penetrate deeper into the hulk's heart, they encounter the first wave
    of Genestealers, a horrifying discovery that the hulk is infested with a full brood
    of these deadly xenos creatures. The team must fight for their lives in the narrow,
    claustrophobic corridors. During a brief respite after a fierce battle, they discover
    that they are not alone - a Dark Angels strike force arrived at the hulk days earlier.
    
    Branching Path 2:
    A) Trust the Dark Angels and combine forces against the Genestealer threat
    B) Pursue objectives independently, suspicious of Dark Angels' ulterior motives

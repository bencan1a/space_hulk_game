  title: "Space Hulk: Echoes of Oblivion"
  setting: "The grim dark future of Warhammer 40,000. Humanity is scattered across the galaxy, beset by endless threats. The story unfolds within the derelict, impossibly vast Space Hulk 'Golgotha's Maw,' a congealed mass of starships, asteroid fragments, and ancient debris. It drifts through the unforgiving void, a tomb and a hive, infused with the psychic echo of countless atrocities. Within its twisting corridors and colossal chambers lurks the Tyranid menace, Genestealers, and worse. The Hulk itself is a character, a labyrinthine, ever-shifting entity that defies logical navigation and conceals untold horrors and forgotten treasures. Humanity's struggle is against not just the alien, but the crushing weight of its own fading hope and the madness of the void."
  themes:
    - Survival Against Overwhelming Odds: The constant struggle for existence in a hostile galaxy.
    - The Corrupting Influence of the Warp/Chaos: Subtle hints and manifestations of malevolent psychic energy.
    - Sacrifice and Duty: The grim resolve of the Imperium's finest to carry out their mission, no matter the cost.
    - The Unknowable Terror: Facing alien lifeforms that defy understanding and rational thought.
    - Echoes of the Past: Discovering historical events and ancient technologies within the Hulk.
    - Moral Compromise: Tough decisions that blur the lines between necessity and atrocity.
  tone: "Bleak, claustrophobic, horror-infused, desperate, heroic, and relentlessly grim. A constant sense of dread and vulnerability, punctuated by moments of desperate heroism and brutal violence. The overarching tone leans heavily into existential dread and the 'lesser of two evils' moral choices inherent to the Warhammer 40,000 universe."

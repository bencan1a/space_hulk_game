      description: "A faint, broken distress signal leads the squad to a hidden pocket of long-lost Imperial citizens, trapped within the Hulk for centuries. They are a corrupted, dying community, unknowingly feeding the Genestealer biomass. The squad faces a dire choice: attempt a perilous, nearly impossible rescue that risks their mission and rapidly dwindling resources, or sacrifice these contaminated souls to preserve their mission's ultimate goal – containing the threat."

        - character: "Brother-Sergeant Kaelen"
          moment: "Kaelen presents a cold, hard statistical analysis of both options, highlighting the low probability of successful rescue and the high risk to the overall mission. His pragmatism, though logical, feels utterly devoid of hope."
        - character: "Brother-Apothecary Tybor"

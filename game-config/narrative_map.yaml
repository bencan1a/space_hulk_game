      name: "Deployment: Entry into the Maw"
      description: "The roar of the Thunderhawk recedes as the Terminator squad, led by Brother-Captain Valerius, is deposited into a cavernous, debris-choked hangar bay within 'The Charon's Omen.' The air is stale, thick with the stench of industry, decay, and something else... something alien. Emergency lights flicker erratically, barely illuminating the colossal, twisted metal structures. Initial scans indicate heavy Tyranid infestation, but also anomalous energy signatures. Valerius asserts command, reminding the squad of their mission: investigate the distress beacon, recover archeotech, and cleanse the xenos."

Kaelan manages to interface with it, activating the ancient distress beacon. It doesn't just broadcast a signal; it projects fragmented data logs and holographic warnings. These reveal an existential, galactic-level threat far beyond the Tyranids, a cosmic horror that the Hulk was designed to contain, or perhaps was even an ark for those fleeing it. The distress signal wasn't just a cry for help, but an ancient warning."

Before the ramps even fully deploy, shrill xenomorphic chittering echoes through the ruptured hangar, and grotesque, multi-limbed horrors, the vanguard of the Genestealer infestation, swarm from the shadows.",

He confronts Valerius, his voice a raw challenge, accusing him of dereliction of duty, of heresy against the Chapter and the Imperium. Varrus grimly readies his weapon, not against the Captain, but against the uncertainty of the situation, a silent threat to any who would falter from their oaths. Lyra, ever the pragmatist, assesses the new parameters, her mind racing to integrate Valerius's revelation into the strategic equation. The squad, once a unified fist of the Emperor, is fractured, trust replaced by suspicion and conflicting loyalties.",

The final moments of the mission are now a desperate sprint, a fight for absolute survival against the collapse of space and time itself, and the last, rabid guardians of the hulk's dark secrets.

    "title": "Space Hulk: Echoes of Perdition",
    "setting": "The game takes place aboard the 'Perdition's Grasp', a colossal, ancient Space Hulk adrift in the treacherous void of the Warhammer 40,000 galaxy. This Space Hulk is a amalgamation of derelict Imperial vessels, xenos craft, and forgotten space stations, fused together by aeons of warp-current travel. Its interior is a labyrinth of rusted bulkheads, decaying technology, and oppressive darkness, punctuated by glowing bio-luminescent fungi and the grotesque organic architecture of the Tyranid infestation. The atmosphere is one of claustrophobic dread and existential horror, where humanity's last stand against an unimaginable threat unfolds amidst the decaying grandeur of a corrupted past. The year is M41, and the Imperium is under siege from countless enemies.",

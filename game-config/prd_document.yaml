  game_title: "Space Hulk: Echoes of the Void"
  game_systems:
    movement:
      description: "Tactical grid-based movement with limited action points per turn. Incorporates environmental hazards (debris, warped floor sections, shifting bulkheads) that can impede movement or trigger events. Special movement actions like 'Brace' to navigate unstable terrain or 'Breach' to open sealed doors."
      commands: ["move", "brace", "breach"]
      narrative_purpose: "Reinforces the claustrophobic and dangerous environment of the Space Hulk ('Man vs. Environment'). Limited movement and hazards emphasize the overwhelming odds and the constant peril. 'Brace' and 'Breach' commands reflect the Terminator's resilience and the need for strategic navigation in a hostile, crumbling vessel, directly feeding into the 'Survival against overwhelming odds' theme."
    inventory:
      description: "Limited capacity inventory for each Space Marine, reflecting their Terminator armor's storage. Focuses on mission-critical wargear, ammo, and a few specialized tools (e.g., Demolition Charges, Auspex Scanner, Medkit). Ammo is scarce, and certain specialized items (like Xylos's psychic foci) are character-bound. Players must manage resources strategically."
      capacity: 5
      commands: ["take", "drop", "use"]
      narrative_purpose: "Scarcity of resources (ammo, medkits) drives the 'Survival against overwhelming odds' and 'Bleak, desperate' tone. Requiring players to carefully manage a limited inventory highlights the grim reality of being stranded and reinforces the idea that every piece of gear is precious. Character-bound items further reinforce individual character roles and their personal struggles (e.g., Xylos's psychic foci being integral to his stability)."
    combat:
      description: "Turn-based tactical combat. Features cover systems, line of sight, and specialized abilities for each Terminator. Enemies have varying types (Genestealers, Cultists, Warp entities) with distinct behaviors and vulnerabilities. Combat emphasizes teamwork and strategic positioning due to overwhelming enemy numbers and character-specific combat roles (e.g., Valerius excels in melee, Theron with ranged suppression)."
      mechanics:
        - name: "Overwatch"
          rules: "Set a character to fire upon enemies entering their line of sight during the enemy turn. This is less effective if not braced or in cover."
        - name: "Psychic Powers"
          rules: "Brother Xylos can unleash offensive or defensive psychic abilities. Each use carries a 'Peril of the Warp' risk, potentially causing self-damage or temporary mental instability (debuffs) if he rolls poorly."
        - name: "Black Rage Meter"
          rules: "Brother Valerius gains 'Frenzy' stacks the more damage he takes or deals in melee. As Frenzy increases, his melee damage and attack speed increase, but his defense decreases, and at critical thresholds, he may act erratically or lash out at allies. Brother-Captain Tyberius also has a Black Rage meter that slowly fills during intense combat and critical narrative moments, affecting his decision-making (e.g., making him prioritize aggressive action over caution)."
        - name: "Squad Cohesion"
          rules: "Adjacent Terminators provide minor buffs (e.g., morale, defense). Separated Terminators suffer penalties (e.g., reduced accuracy, increased 'Man vs. Self' debuff chances)."
      narrative_purpose: "The tactical, turn-based nature, coupled with overwhelming odds, directly supports 'Man vs. Xenos' and 'Survival against overwhelming odds.' 'Overwatch' reflects the cautious, disciplined nature of Space Marine combat. 'Psychic Powers' for Xylos ties into his arc of fragility and power, representing the 'Corrupting influence of the Warp' and 'Man vs. Self.' The 'Black Rage Meter' is a direct manifestation of the Blood Angels' curse ('Man vs. Self'), forcing players to manage Valerius's raw power against his impending madness and hinting at Tyberius's own internal struggles. 'Squad Cohesion' mechanically reinforces the importance of teamwork and brotherhood, a core Space Marine value, while highlighting the danger of being separated in the claustrophobic Hulk."
    interaction:
      description: "Allows players to interact with objects, environments, and even character-specific internal thoughts. Primarily used for narrative progression, puzzle-solving (e.g., accessing locked areas, analyzing alien tech), and uncovering lore. Commands change based on context and character. Also includes 'Dialogue' options for inter-squad communication and for specific narrative choices."
      commands: ["examine", "talk", "use", "analyze"]
      narrative_purpose: "'Examine' and 'Analyze' allow players to uncover crucial lore about the Hulk's origins, the Genestealer Cult, and the Warp's influence, deepening the 'Man vs. Unknown/Cosmic Horror' theme. 'Talk' options drive character arcs, allowing players to witness or influence the internal struggles of their squadmates ('Man vs. Self'), leading to deeper engagement with the themes of 'Duty vs. Conscience' and 'The dehumanizing nature of constant warfare.' This system facilitates the critical decision points that define story branches and endings."
  game_state:
    tracked_variables:
      - variable: "squad_morale"
        purpose: "Tracks the overall mental state of the squad, influenced by combat outcomes, narrative events (e.g., witnessing horrors, making grim choices), and squad cohesion. High morale provides minor buffs; low morale increases debuff chances (e.g., Black Rage triggers, Peril of the Warp probability)."
      - variable: "tyberius_black_rage_progress"
        purpose: "A hidden meter tracking how close Brother-Captain Tyberius is to succumbing to the Black Rage. Influenced by major narrative decisions, witnessing squadmate deaths, and prolonged exposure to Warp events. Affects available dialogue options and ultimately influences the choices available at 'The Serpent's Purpose' (e.g., sacrificing himself becoming an easier decision if already close to the brink)."
      - variable: "hulk_data_logs_collected"
        purpose: "Counts the number of lore fragments, xeno-tech reports, and Imperial records discovered. Unlocking more logs provides deeper insight into the Hulk's history, the Genestealer threat, and the Warp's influence, enriching the cosmic horror aspect. Some unique logs can trigger Xylos's psychic visions or Theron's analysis."
      - variable: "resources_remaining"
        purpose: "Tracks critical consumables like ammo, medkits, and power cells. Directly impacts 'Survival against overwhelming odds' and influences tactical choices in combat and exploration."
      - variable: "chapter_vulnerability_rating"
        purpose: "Influenced by choices like 'Signal Battle Barge to sacrifice itself.' This variable would impact the flavor text of the 'Aftermath' scenes, reflecting the long-term strategic consequences for the Blood Angels Chapter."
    win_conditions:
      - condition: "Successfully neutralize the threat posed by 'The Serpent's Coil' by either destroying it or diverting it from Imperial worlds, leading to one of the 'Aftermath' scenes ('pyrrhic_victory' or 'grim_sacrifice')."
    lose_conditions:
      - condition: "All squad members are incapacitated or killed in combat."
      - condition: "The 'CATASTROPHIC FAILURE' outcome is reached due to player choices or mission failure, resulting in 'The Serpent's Coil' reaching an Imperial world undeterred."
      - condition: "Certain character-specific critical failures (e.g., Xylos succumbing fully to the Warp and becoming a permanent threat, or Valerius's Black Rage leading to friendly fire and squad wipe)."
  technical_requirements:
    - requirement: "Robust AI for diverse enemy types (Genestealers, Cultists, minor Warp entities) with distinct attack patterns and tactical behaviors."

    - requirement: "Branching narrative engine with robust state-tracking for choices and consequences, leading to multiple distinct endings and character fates."
      justification: "Critical for fulfilling the 'Duty vs. Conscience' theme and providing player agency in a grimdark setting, ensuring that the final choice at 'The Serpent's Purpose' feels impactful and genuinely alters the game's conclusion."
    - requirement: "Atmospheric audio design prioritizing immersive soundscapes (creaking metal, distant chittering, Warp whispers) and impactful combat sound effects."
      justification: "Enhances the 'Bleak, claustrophobic, unyielding terror' tone, drawing players deeper into the grimdark setting and heightening the sense of dread and tension."

      name: "Deployment: Entry into the Maw"
      description: "The Thunderhawk's dying roar reverberates through the colossal, reeking hangar bay, leaving behind an oppressive silence. Twisted metal skeletons of long-dead vessels loom in the oppressive gloom, their ruined forms half-swallowed by organic growths that pulse with a faint, sickly light. Emergency lights, sporadic and weak, cast long, dancing shadows, distorting the vastness of the hulk, revealing glimpses of corroded adamantium and glistening, chitinous residue. The air is a noxious cocktail of stale machinery, death, and an indescribable, alien musk that prickles the lungs. Every scuff of a ceramite boot echoes unnaturally, and the squad's power armor hums like a fragile heartbeat in the overwhelming silence."
      atmosphere: "Bleak, claustrophobic, and heavy with foreboding. The mood is one of stoic resolve against an overwhelming, decaying environment."
      initial_text: "Brother-Captain Valerius, your gauntleted hand instinctively brushes the Aquila on your chest plate. The air analyzer on your helmet reads 'Atmospheric Integrity: Compromised. Biological Contaminants: High. Anomalous Energy Signatures: Detected.' The mission begins."
      examination_texts:
        hull_breach: "A jagged maw in the colossal hull, ringed with what appears to be a solidified, crystalline biological excretion. This is where the Thunderhawk deposited you. Beyond it, the void."
        derelict_shuttle: "The skeletal remains of an ancient Imperial shuttle, partially fused into the hangar deck. Its designation, 'Glorious Indifference', is still faintly visible, a bleak testament to prior attempts at exploration or escape."
        bio_growth: "A thick, pulsing mat of fungal-like growth snaking across the floor and walls, its tendrils reaching towards the few flickering lights. It appears unnervingly vibrant amidst the decay."
      dialogue:
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Valerius"
          text: "Status report. Initial scans confirm heavy Tyranid infestation. Kaelan, focus on anomalous energy signatures. Lyra, sample the biological contaminants. Titus, secure our perimeter.

        - speaker: "Apothecary Lyra"
          text: "Interesting... preliminary scans of the bio-mass suggest highly unusual cellular structures. Far more complex than typical Tyranid sporophytes, Brother-Captain. I'll need a deeper sample."
          context: "Lyra kneels, a servo-arm extending from her Narthecium to carefully extract a glowing portion of the fungi."
          emotion: "Curious, professional"
        - speaker: "Techmarine Kaelan"
          text: "Affirmative, Brother-Captain. Primary scan arrays deployed. Energy signatures are... erratic. Fluctuating between low-frequency harmonics and high-amplitude pulses. Non-Imperial origin confirmed. Probability of archeotech, 78.4%."
          context: "Kaelan's vox-cowl distorts his voice slightly as his mechadendrites snake out, their optical sensors whirring as they sweep the darkness."
      narrative_notes: "Establishes the grim setting and the initial mission parameters. Introduces the core conflict (Tyranid vs. Archeotech) and the distinct personalities of the squad members, setting the stage for their individual arcs."
    scene_02_first_contact:
      name: "First Contact: Skittering Shadows"
      description: "Narrow, rust-eaten corridors stretch into the inky blackness, each twist and turn a new vista of decay. Exposed conduits spark angrily, casting fleeting, spectral light on walls covered in a greasy film and grotesque, skeletal remnants of past conflicts. The air grows heavier, punctuated by the rhythmic drip of unseen fluids and a faint, high-pitched skittering that seems to emanate from all directions at once. Without warning, the shadows themselves coalesce, erupting into a whirlwind of chitin, claws, and gnashing teeth. The guttural shrieks of Genestealers fill the limited space, their alien forms a terrifying blur in the emergency lights' fitful glow."
      atmosphere: "Tense, violent, and claustrophobic. The immediate threat of xenos combat blends with the lingering sense of ancient mysteries."
      initial_text: "The thrum of your power armor's systems is a drumbeat against the escalating cacophony of skittering claws and primal hunger. Combat is upon you."
      examination_texts:
        genestealer_corpse: "The slain Genestealer lies twitching, its segmented carapace now marred by boltgun fire and power weapon slashes. Its six limbs are still horribly sharp, and its distinct four-armed physiology is a chilling reminder of its deadly efficiency."
        ancient_console: "Beneath a recent Tyranid effluvium, a control console of intricate, non-Imperial design. Its power cells are long dead, but the pict-screen still shows faded, ghostly images of unfamiliar human iconography."
        wall_scoring: "Deep gouges in the adamantium wall, distinct from Tyranid claw marks. They appear ancient, almost ritualistic, hinting at a purpose beyond simple destruction."
      dialogue:
        - speaker: "Sergeant Titus"
          text: "For Macragge! Purge the xenos scum!"

        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Valerius"
          text: "Focus, Kaelan. Lyra, did you acquire any samples from the deceased? Proceed with caution, squad. These discoveries are unexpected."
          context: "Valerius surveys the carnage, his bolter cooling, a flicker of something beyond tactical assessment in his gaze as he hears Kaelan's report."
          emotion: "Guarded curiosity"
      narrative_notes: "Establishes the immediate Tyranid threat and introduces the first hints of an ancient origin for the Hulk, directly challenging Imperial dogma and raising questions about its unique nature. This marks the beginning of Valerius's internal conflict and further develops each character's reaction to the unknown."
    scene_03_ancient_discovery:
      name: "Echoes of a Lost Era"
      description: "Beyond the ravaged sections, the Hulk transforms. The architecture shifts from crude, fused wrecks to surprisingly intact, elegant structures. Corridors expand into vast chambers, their ceilings lost in the perpetual gloom, revealing intricate, geometric designs unlike any Imperial standard. Faint, bioluminescent flora, unlike anything recorded, shimmers on smooth, unnatural surfaces. Here, the Tyranid infestation is less chaotic, more... integrated, as if the bio-forms are attempting to mimic or consume a pre-existing, complex order. Ancient pict-logs flicker to life, showing rudimentary holographic images of pre-Imperial humans, their technology advanced but alien to Imperial eyes. The pervasive sense of dread deepens, growing less like animal fear and more like existential unease, as the anomalous energy signature burns brighter, pinpointing the source of the distress beacon."
      atmosphere: "Mysterious, awe-inspiring, and deeply unsettling. The discovery of a lost human civilization generates a sense of wonder mixed with profound dread. Cosmic horror deepens."
      initial_text: "You stand at the threshold of a forgotten history. The air itself seems to hum with silent echoes of a civilization long past. A single, luminous blossom unfurls in the eerie light, its petals alien and beautiful."
      examination_texts:
        ancient_artifact: "A metallic sphere, almost perfectly smooth, humming with a barely perceptible internal energy. Its surface is adorned with symbols that resemble constellations, but not those of Imperial charting. It feels cold to the touch."
        pict_archive_fragment: "A decaying data slate showing fragmented images of a bustling city skyline with towering, elegant spires and unfamiliar flying craft. The figures are unmistakably human, but their attire and technology are utterly alien to Imperial records."
        integrated_bioform: "A Tyranid organism, partially encased in a crystalline structure, its chitinous form fused with the ancient architecture. It pulses with a soft, blue internal light, an unholy marriage of xenos and forgotten tech."
      dialogue:
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Valerius"
          text: "These... these are human. But not of the Imperium. By the Emperor's grace, what happened here? Kaelan, can you trace the archives' origin?"
          context: "Valerius stares at a flickering pict-log, his helmet's internal lights reflecting off the ancient images, his usual composure visibly strained."
          emotion: "Shocked, thoughtful"
        - speaker: "Sergeant Titus"
          text: "Profane! Heresy! These blasphemous images must be purged! How could mankind exist beyond the Emperor's light without falling to Chaos?"
          context: "Titus raises his storm bolter, his faceplate contorted with disgust and anger, aiming at the pict-log."
          emotion: "Enraged, fearful"
        - speaker: "Apothecary Lyra"
          text: "No, Titus! This is a precious archaeological find, proof of galactic humanity before the Imperium! And this flora... utterly unique. Adaptations completely alien to terraformed worlds or even typical xenos flora."
          context: "Lyra moves to protect a delicate, glowing plant, her Narthecium tools humming with excitement."
          emotion: "Excited, protective"
        - speaker: "Techmarine Kaelan"
          text: "Data fragments suggest an advanced, pre-Imperial human civilization. Energy signatures now triangulate directly ahead. The distress beacon originates from a central hub within this complex. Its power output is astronomical, beyond standard warp-field generation."
          context: "Kaelan's mechadendrites tap furiously at his data-slate, his vox-cowl whirring with data streams."
          emotion: "Intrigued, analytical"
      narrative_notes: "Deepens the mystery and the internal conflict within Valerius and the squad. Directly confronts Imperial dogma with undeniable evidence of a lost human past. Lyra's scientific curiosity and Kaelan's analytical focus clash with Titus's zealous rejection, driving the character arcs."
    scene_04_beacon_chamber:
      name: "The Primordial Warning"
      description: "A colossal, perfectly spherical chamber, its surface a seamless, dark obsidian that seems to drink the light. At its heart, a shimmering, crystalline pylon, many stories high, hums with contained energy. Woven into the obsidian walls are intricate, luminescent patterns that pulse in time with the pylon, depicting shifting, abstract forms that suggest colossal, eldritch entities and swirling nebulae. As Kaelan interfaces with the array, the chamber becomes saturated with light and sound -- not a simple static signal, but a torrent of fragmented holographic projections and a cacophony of ancient human voices. These voices, filled with desperate urgency, speak of an 'Unmaker,' a 'Cosmic Hunger,' and a fate far worse than death, far beyond the reach of the Tyranids. The projections show unimaginable horrors stretching across the void, and the Hulk itself, depicted as a desperate, final ark."
      atmosphere: "Ominous, revelatory, and horrifying. The truth of the unknown threat finally unspools, provoking existential dread and a sense of overwhelming smallness."
      initial_text: "The sheer scale of the chamber is breathtaking, its purpose now chillingly clear. As Kaelan’s augury clicks, the air crackles with forgotten knowledge, and a truth too vast for mortal minds begins to unfold."
      examination_texts:
        communication_pylon: "The central crystalline structure, pulsating with contained energy. It feels ancient beyond measuring, its purpose a desperate plea across millennia. Kaelan's interface cables glow with the data transfer."
        holographic_projections: "Fragmented images flicker and whirl across the obsidian walls: spiraling galaxies consumed by darkness, ancient star-charts marked with impossible anomalies, and frantic figures fleeing into what appears to be the nascent Space Hulk."
        obsidian_wall_engravings: "Beneath the projections, intricate carvings depict cosmic maps and constellations. Some are recognizable, others utterly alien, charting dangers unknown to Imperial astronomers."
      dialogue:
        - speaker: "Techmarine Kaelan"
          text: "Data stream... immense. Processing... The distress beacon is active. It's not a simple call for help. It's a warning. A warning of an existential threat. galactic scale... The Unmaker... The Cosmic Hunger..."
          context: "Kaelan struggles to maintain the interface, his mechadendrites straining as the volume of data overwhelms his systems. His voice is a strained, almost reverent whisper."
          emotion: "Overwhelmed, awestruck"
        - speaker: "Apothecary Lyra"
          text: "By the Emperor... this is not simply xenos. This is... a cosmic truth. This data is critical! It speaks of something beyond even the Tyranids! A threat that consumes existence itself!"
          context: "Lyra stares, transfixed, at the holographic projections, her mind racing to process the implications."
          emotion: "Horrified, desperate"
        - speaker: "Sergeant Titus"
          text: "Silence! This is heresy! A lie! The Omnissiah preserve us! This... this knowledge is a poison that will corrupt us all! Destroy it, Brother-Captain, NOW!"
          context: "Titus struggles against an unseen force, his mind assailed by the projections and archaic voices, his hands trembling as he raises his bolter towards the pylon."
          emotion: "Terrified, fanatical"
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Valerius"
          text: "Titus, stand down! Kaelan, Lyra, confirm the authenticity of this data. A threat beyond Tyranids... this changes everything. Our mission objective has broadened beyond anything we could have imagined."
          context: "Valerius stands resolute against the onslaught of information, his eyes narrowed, the weight of a galactic truth settling heavily upon his shoulders."
          emotion: "Calculated, burdened"
      narrative_notes: "This is the climax of the information gathering. The true stakes are revealed, placing the squad (and the player) at the precipice of a cosmic horror. The distinct reactions of the squad set up the coming schism and Valerius's ultimate moral dilemma. This directly leads into the decision point scene."
    scene_05_the_schism:
      name: "Crossroads of Duty"
      description: "The colossal chamber, still humming with the aftershocks of the ancient warning, now feels charged with a different kind of tension. The echoes of the 'Unmaker' reverberate not just in the air, but in the very souls of the Terminators. The air is thick with unspoken fear and burgeoning anger. Titus stands rigid, his faceplate fixed on Valerius, his bolter held too tightly. Lyra paces, her arguments spilling forth, her gaze earnest and desperate. Kaelan is a statue of logic, his mechadendrites twitching impatiently as he awaits a command. Valerius stands at the epicenter, the holographic warning shimmering faintly around him, symbolizing the impossible choice he faces. The very foundations of his faith, his training, and his duty are being rent asunder before his eyes."
      atmosphere: "Intense, conflicted, and morally heavy. A sense of impending doom coupled with the weight of an impossible decision."
      initial_text: "The silence that follows Kaelan's grim pronouncements is shattered by the raw, clashing ideologies of your squad. The fate of the Imperium, perhaps the galaxy, rests on your next command, Brother-Captain."
      examination_texts:
        valerius_helmet: "Reflected in your helmet's visor, the faces of your squad, their emotions stark and warring. Titus, enraged. Lyra, pleading. Kaelan, analytical. All await your word."
        ancient_archive_console: "The ancient console, still glowing faintly, represents a treasure trove of invaluable knowledge... or a conduit for unimaginable malevolence. Its fate is in your hands."
        space_hulk_schematics: "Kaelan displays a schematic of 'The Charon's Omen,' highlighting structural weaknesses that could be exploited for either total destruction or strategic sealing. Time is running out."
      dialogue:
        - speaker: "Sergeant Titus"
          text: "Brother-Captain, this... this is a trap! A perversion! This knowledge will only corrupt. We must cleanse it! Destroy this foul archive and all traces of its heresy before more minds are poisoned!"
          context: "Titus's voice is hoarse, edged with a desperate fervor, his hand hovering over his melta-gun, ready to reduce the console to slag."
          emotion: "Anguished, absolute"
        - speaker: "Apothecary Lyra"
          text: "No! Titus, think! This is a warning! A truth! To destroy it would be to condemn generations to ignorance! This data, Brother-Captain, could change the course of galactic history, arm us against an enemy we cannot even comprehend!"
          context: "Lyra steps between Titus and the console, her voice pleading, her scientific passion overriding her usual calm."
          emotion: "Passionate, urgent"
        - speaker: "Techmarine Kaelan"
          text: "Logically, the preservation of this anomalous data set is of paramount strategic value. Analysis indicates a 93.7% probability that its information could inform defensive protocols against xenos threats of unknown classification. Destruction would represent an irreparable loss of tactical advantage."
          context: "Kaelan's vox-cowl offers a cold, hard logic, ignoring the emotional turmoil around him."
          emotion: "Logical, objective"
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Valerius"
          text: "Silence! All of you! I hear your arguments. Titus, your purity. Lyra, your knowledge. Kaelan, your logic. But the choice... the choice is mine. And the burden of it, mine alone. What is the greater duty? To protect the Imperium from dangerous truth, or to arm it with a desperate, terrifying warning?"
          context: "Valerius's voice is low, gravelly, betraying the immense internal struggle. He looks between his squad members, his decision yet unmade."
          emotion: "Gravely resolute, conflicted"
      narrative_notes: "This scene is the central moral dilemma, the 'point of no return' for Valerius. It forces a direct player choice that will dramatically alter the subsequent narrative path and character arcs. The dialogue highlights each character's core motivations and beliefs, creating a true schism within the squad."
    scene_06a_pursue_destruction:
      name: "Path of Anihilation"
      description: "The choice is made. Valerius's command seals the fate of the ancient archive, an act that resonates like a death knell in the vast chamber. A harsh, almost metallic tang fills the air as Kaelan, under Valerius's grim instruction, initiates the archive's overload protocols, reducing the crystalline pylon and its invaluable data to superheated slag. The squad's path now narrows to a singular, brutal purpose: locate and annihilate the burgeoning threat. The corridors ahead are even more choked with Tyranid forms, their numbers swelling with a grotesque eagerness. From the depths, the whispers intensify – not intellectual warnings anymore, but raw, insidious psychic attacks, attempting to sow discord and despair, but Valerius’s resolve, though heavy, is unyielding."
      atmosphere: "Grim, determined, and brutally efficient. A sense of righteous anger mixed with a subconscious unease. The horror becomes more direct, less subtle."
      initial_text: "With the archive's destruction, the weight of potential knowledge is lifted, replaced by the grim certainty of your chosen path. The Xenos threat, however, intensifies, its whispers now a tangible assault on your will."
      examination_texts:
        slagged_archive: "The remnants of the ancient communication pylon are a molten, twisted mockery of their former glory, a testament to the Imperium's choice of ignorance over dangerous truth."
        intensified_bioforms: "The Tyranids here are more active, more desperate. They seem drawn to a central point, their forms glistening with a malicious focus, almost as if herded by an unseen will."
        corrosion_stain: "A new, virulent strain of corrosive residue smears the walls, burning through even adamantium plating. The manifestation of the prime threat is becoming physically undeniable."
      dialogue:

          emotion: "Righteous, relieved"
        - speaker: "Apothecary Lyra"
          text: "A tragic loss of data. The scale of this unique xeno-evolution... unprecedented. And now, undiscovered. What insights might we have gained to combat it?"

          emotion: "Disappointed, somber"
        - speaker: "Techmarine Kaelan"
          text: "Data integrity: zero. Archeotech retrieval: failed. Tactical efficiency necessitates direct engagement with origin point. Energy signature continues to escalate."
          context: "Kaelan's analysis is cold and factual, devoid of emotion, but the subtle tremor in his mechadendrites suggests a suppressed vexation."
          emotion: "Blunt, logical (with undertones of vexation)"
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Valerius"
          text: "The past is gone. Our future lies in cleansing this blight. Titus, lead the vanguard. Kaelan, track the entity's core. Lyra, maintain our combat effectiveness. For Humanity. For the Emperor."
          context: "Valerius's voice is firm, unwavering, yet a shadow of doubt flickers across his features as he contemplates the path of absolute destruction."
          emotion: "Firm, subtly conflicted"
      narrative_notes: "This path reinforces Valerius's rigid adherence to Imperial dogma, showcasing the 'purity over knowledge' theme. Titus regains his zeal, while Lyra and Kaelan express clear disappointment, further developing their character arcs and the internal squad dynamics. The narrative drives towards direct confrontation with the enemy."
    scene_06b_pursue_retrieval:
      name: "Path of Illumination"
      description: "The decision reverberates through the chamber, splitting the squad with an invisible chasm. Titus stands apart, a radiating point of seething indignation. Yet, Valerius's voice, though burdened, holds authority. The ancient console, saved from destruction, now becomes the focal point for Kaelan's frenzied data extraction, a luminous beacon in the gloom. The path forward is no longer merely infested; it is actively hostile, writhing with a malevolent intelligence. The Tyranids seem driven to a desperate frenzy, their attacks more coordinated, their roars laced with a frustrated intelligence. Crucially, the psychic whispers are no longer simply warnings, but sharp, probing tendrils attempting to infiltrate their minds, promising power, offering escape, sowing discord, as if the nascent entity recognizes the theft of its secrets and seeks to reclaim them through psychological warfare."
      atmosphere: "Tense, defiant, and psychologically perilous. A sense of urgency and profound risk hangs heavy. The horror becomes more cerebral and insidious."
      initial_text: "You have chosen the path less traveled by your brethren. The ancient knowledge may be yours, but the cost will be measured in more than blood. The entity lashes out, its psychic tendrils seeking purchase in your very soul."

        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Valerius"
          text: "Hold fast, Kaelan. Lyra, prepare for increased xenos hostility. Titus, your duty is to the squad, to the Imperium. Follow my lead, or be left behind to face your convictions alone. We retrieve this data, then we confront the source."
          context: "Valerius's posture is tense, his voice firm, projecting an authority that dares not be questioned, despite the emotional cost."
          emotion: "Assertive, burdened"
      narrative_notes: "This path highlights Valerius's deviation from rigid dogma, forcing him to assert leadership amidst defiance. Lyra and Kaelan are empowered, while Titus's arc of strained loyalty begins.

      name: "The Heart of Oblivion"
      description: "The corridors finally culminate in a vast, impossibly dark expanse, a colossal cavern where reality itself seems to fray at the edges. Here, the absence of light is not just gloom, but an active, consuming void. At the heart of this abyss is not a creature, but a fluctuating, multi-dimensional vortex of swirling energy and half-glimpsed horrors – a nascent, trans-dimensional entity. It expands and contracts, its presence so overwhelming that your vision swims, your mind screams in silent protest. Walls bleed in impossible geometries, and the Tyranids, reduced to mere puppets, hurl themselves mindlessly towards the squad, their forms twisted and distended by the entity's influence. It touches your thoughts, probing, whispering of forgotten fears and cosmic insignificance, testing the very limits of your sanity and faith. This is the Unmaker, the Cosmic Hunger, and it is almost free."
      atmosphere: "Cosmic horror, mind-bending, and overwhelmingly terrifying. A sense of ultimate confrontation where physical and psychological boundaries dissolve."

          emotion: "Distressed, struggling"
      narrative_notes: "This scene is the direct confrontation with the ultimate antagonist. It tests each character's mental and physical limits. The psychic horror element is paramount, and the Tyranids serve as mere extensions of the greater entity. The outcome of the previous decision impacts Kaelan's actions and Lyra's tactical advice, setting the stage for the final resolution."

      name: "The Ultimate Sacrifice"
      description: "The immense cavern shudders, adamantium groaning under impossible strain as the nascent entity churns and twists, its form growing more defined, more horrifically complete. The Space Hulk itself is dying, collapsing inward, threatening to tear itself apart – or worse, to become a massive, trans-dimensional gateway for the entity's full arrival into reality. Warning klaxons blare, not from Imperial systems, but from the very structure of 'The Charon's Omen,' a final, ancient cry for help. Time is a tangible, vanishing commodity. Valerius stands amidst the chaos, his squad battered but unbent, their faces grim with the knowledge of imminent doom. The fate of the galaxy, a thought too vast to comprehend, rests in the last, desperate choice he must make."
      atmosphere: "Desperate, apocalyptic, and profoundly sacrificial. The mood is one of overwhelming odds and inevitable, world-shattering consequences."
      initial_text: "The Space Hulk screams its death throes, and the entity roars its triumph. The battle is lost, but the war for the galaxy is not. Your final, most terrible choice awaits, Brother-Captain."
      examination_texts:
        collapsing_hulk_structure: "Massive girders warp, twist, and snap, raining superheated shrapnel onto the cavern floor. The entire structure is moments from collapsing or being subsumed by the entity."
        entity_manifestation: "The entity's form is almost complete, a gaping maw of cosmic scale, its eyes ancient and utterly malevolent. It strains against some unseen barrier, eager to burst forth."
        critically_damaged_terminal: "A flickering terminal, barely functional, connected to the Hulk's core systems. Kaelan is trying to interface with it, offering grim options for the Hulk's ultimate fate."

        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Valerius"
          text: "Kaelan! Final options! How do we contain this horror? Lyra, what are its weaknesses? Titus... prepare for the Emperor's judgment!"
          context: "Valerius's voice is raw, strained, but still radiating command, his gaze unflinching as he faces the apocalypse."

          emotion: "Urgent, calculating"
        - speaker: "Techmarine Kaelan"
          text: "Hulk core systems critical. Three primary options. Option A: Core structural implosion, localized containment. High risk of squad loss, moderate data transmission probability (if applicable). Option B: Mass warp-core breach, complete destruction of Hulk and contents. Zero survival probability. Option C: Gravitational redirection into localized pseudo-singularity. Minimal data survivability, unknown warp consequences. Recommend immediate decision."
          context: "Kaelan's vox-cowl is distorted by static, but his data download is grimly clear, laying out the impossible choices with chilling precision."
          emotion: "Grave, logical"
      narrative_notes: "This scene is the ultimate decision point, the culmination of Valerius's journey. All previous narrative threads (archeotech, cosmic horror, internal conflict) converge. It forces the player to choose between containment, self-sacrifice, or unknown oblivion, determining the ultimate ending and the fate of the entire squad. This directly leads to the different ending scenes."
    scene_ending_containment:
      name: "Ending: The Sealed Horror"
      description: "With a guttural roar of command from Valerius, and Kaelan's desperate commands echoing through the vox, the ancient structural lock-downs on 'The Charon's Omen' engage with agonizing slowness. Massive adamantium bulkheads, powered by straining plasma conduits, grind shut, severing the cavern from the rest of the hulk. The entity's furious shriek reverberates as it finds itself trapped, confined once more to its primordial prison. The squad, battered and scarred, barely escapes the rapidly closing maw, stumbling back into the relative 'safety' of other corridors. The hulk itself silences, becoming a tomb. The warning data, salvaged if Valerius chose that path, hums with desperate truth. The galaxy remains ignorant of the true scope of its deliverance, but the cost, and the knowledge of the lurking horror, will forever haunt those who witnessed it."
      atmosphere: "Somber, relief mixed with trauma. A sense of lingering dread and the heavy weight of a secret knowledge."
      initial_text: "You have confined the darkness, yet its shadow falls heavy upon your soul. The Imperium is safe, for now, but a terrible truth has been revealed, and you are its reluctant guardian."
      examination_texts:
        sealed_bulkhead: "A colossal, fused bulkhead, still vibrating with incredible power, now eternally seals off the chamber of the Unmaker. Its metallic skin feels cold, an alien prison door."
        unsettled_squad: "Your squad stands around you, relieved but shaken. Titus glances suspiciously at Lyra, who grips the retrieved data-slate tightly, her eyes wide with a new understanding, a new burden."
        damaged_aurora: "The Thunderhawk, slightly damaged but functional, waits for your return. The journey back to Imperial space feels impossibly long, weighed down by unspoken truths."

          emotion: "Relieved, but still wary"
        - speaker: "Apothecary Lyra"
          text: "The data is secure, Brother-Captain. Its implications are profound. It will take years, perhaps centuries, to decipher its warnings fully. But it is here. Humanity has a chance."
          context: "Lyra clutches the data-slate, her eyes gleaming with exhausted triumph and the weight of immense responsibility."
          emotion: "Triumphant, but sobered"
        - speaker: "Techmarine Kaelan"
          text: "Structural integrity of containment holding at 89.2%. Extraction sequence initiated. Recommend immediate departure. Probability of secondary event: 11.5% and rising."
          context: "Kaelan, ever practical, cuts through the emotional aftermath with hard data, focusing on immediate next steps."
          emotion: "Strained, efficient"
      narrative_notes: "This ending provides a grim victory, highlighting the theme of 'survival at a cost.' Valerius is transformed into a guardian of a terrible secret. Lyra's arc reaches intellectual validation, while Titus remains conflicted. Kaelan fulfills his data retrieval directive, but all are irrevocably changed."
    scene_ending_self_destruct:
      name: "Ending: Ultimate Sacrifice"
      description: "With a single, grim command, Valerius initiates the Space Hulk's ancient self-destruct sequence. A deep, resonant thrum vibrates through the entire structure, growing into a titanic roar that drowns out the entity's frustrated howls. Plasma conduits overload, fusion reactors plunge into critical runaway. The very fabric of 'The Charon's Omen' begins to unravel, consumed by a blinding, incandescent light that grows exponentially. The squad stands together, silhouetted against the burgeoning cataclysm, their forms resolute, accepting their fate. In a final, glorious flash, the Hulk, the entity, and the Ultramarines are consumed, utterly obliterated. No warning is passed on. No trace of the cosmic horror remains, but at the cost of utter obliteration, humanity is unknowingly spared."

          emotion: "Calm, dutiful"
      narrative_notes: "This ending emphasizes the theme of ultimate sacrifice and the grim necessity of the Imperium's survival at all costs, even if unknown. Valerius becomes a true martyr. Titus dies in zealous glory. Lyra expresses sorrow over lost knowledge, and Kaelan's duty is fulfilled completely. It offers a bleak, heroic, and final conclusion."

      description: "Kaelan's bionic hands fly across the failing console, rerouting power, shifting gravitational fields, and initiating archaic thruster arrays. With a last, agonizing groan, 'The Charon's Omen' begins to pivot, its colossal form aimed directly at a nearby, shimmering tear in reality – a nascent warp rift. The pull is immediate, irresistible. The entity within howls in furious dismay as it is dragged towards an eternal, featureless void. The Space Hulk, still infested with Tyranids, its ancient structures now twisting under immense gravitational strain, is slowly, inevitably consumed by the maw of oblivion. The squad, bracing against the impossible forces, faces a fate beyond even death, erased from time and memory, taking with them all knowledge of the Unmaker to an unending and unknowable prison."

          emotion: "Logical, fatalistic"
      narrative_notes: "This ending offers a profoundly ambiguous resolution, highlighting themes of cosmic insignificance and the loss of vital information. Valerius makes a tactically brilliant but existentially horrifying decision. Titus faces ultimate fear, Lyra's intellectual pursuits end tragically, and Kaelan's logical efficiency finds its ultimate expression in self-annihilation. It's a true 'cosmic horror' ending."

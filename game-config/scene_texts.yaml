    scene_drop_pod_descent:
      name: "The Drop Pod Descent"
      description: "The void screeches a cacophony of tortured metal and strained ceramite as the drop pod lances through the orbital debris, a spear-tip aimed at the monstrous Space Hulk, 'The Serpent's Coil.' Inside, the guts of the pod groan, bulkheads shriek, and emergency lights flicker like dying stars. Alarms blare an erratic rhythm, punctuated by the dull thud of impacts. Through the tiny, reinforced viewport, you glimpse twisted hulls and skeletal superstructures, all woven into a grotesque tapestry. The air, thick with the tang of ozone and a faint, cloying sweetness, crackles with latent Warp energy, a malevolent hum that vibrates through your Terminator armor."
      atmosphere: "Chaotic, violent, disorienting, ominous, foreboding."
      initial_text: "Impact imminent! Brace for uncontrolled descent!"
      examination_texts:
        comms_array: "The integral vox-caster array is spitting static, an angry electrical current buzzing against your gauntlet. Severely damaged, only faint, distorted whispers pierce the din."
        drop_pod_hatch: "The massive ceramite hatch is buckled inwards at one corner, scorch marks marring its integrity. It remains sealed for now, a flimsy barrier against the void and whatever primordial horrors await."
        squad_status_displays: "Most displays are dark or flashing error codes. Brother Valerius' icon blazes green, a predatory readiness radiating even from the inert display. Brother-Captain Tyberius' remains a steady, unwavering red, signifying command functions and active internal diagnostics."
      dialogue:
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Tyberius"
          text: "Status report! Comm-link non-responsive. Valerius, Xylos, Theron, confirm vitals!"
          context: "As the drop pod shudders violently from impacts."
        - speaker: "Brother Valerius"
          text: "All systems nominal, Captain! Eager for contact! Let the Xenos come!"
          emotion: "Anticipatory, aggressive"
          context: "A growl in his voice, even through the vox."
        - speaker: "Brother Xylos"
          text: "Psychic barrier holding. But the Warp... it's a living entity in this place, Captain. Pressing."
          emotion: "Strained, warning"
          context: "His voice a low thrum of suppressed psionic energy."
        - speaker: "Sergeant Theron"
          text: "Heavy impacts detected. Hull breaches contained. Weapons hot."
          emotion: "Laconical, professional"
          context: "His vox crackles with a metallic undertone."
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Tyberius"
          text: "The Emperor protects! But even His light flickers in this accursed place. Comms still down. My augurs show scatter protocols initiated... we're alone, for now. Find a way out, brothers. We regroup and purge this abomination!"
          emotion: "Grim determination, slight frustration"
          context: "After several attempts to re-establish communications."
      narrative_notes: "This scene establishes the immediate chaos and danger of the insertion. It introduces the squad members and their initial reactions, sets the claustrophobic and grimdark tone, and immediately highlights the isolation and the pervasive Warp influence. Tyberius' struggle with comms and the reality of his scattered squad begins his character arc with the weight of command."
    scene_whispers_in_the_dark:
      name: "Whispers in the Dark"
      description: "The emergency lights, ancient and feeble, bleed weak pools of amber light into the oppressive gloom of the Hulk's corridors. They flicker erratically, casting elongated, dancing shadows that seem to writhe with malevolent life. Grotesque murals, etched into the rust-pitted bulkheads, depict multi-limbed horrors worshipped by crude, mutated figures. Here and there, skeletal remains in tattered Imperial Guard uniforms, or the grotesque, desiccated husks of Adeptus Mechanicus, are impaled or fused to the walls, silent witnesses to countless failed purges. The chilling, high-pitched chitter of unseen creatures echoes from the darkness ahead, a predatory invitation."
      atmosphere: "Ominous, horrifying, tense, claustrophobic, grim."
      initial_text: "The darkness presses in, alive with unseen horrors. The stench of decay and something far fouler fills the air."
      examination_texts:
        grotesque_murals: "Crude, yet disturbingly detailed, charnel-house art. They depict Xenos worshipped as gods, their vile forms rendered with disturbing reverence by mutated hands. A perversion of faith."
        skeletal_remains: "The contorted remains of a previous Imperial expedition, picked clean, their equipment long stripped away. A grim testament to the Hulk's insatiable hunger. One almost-intact helmet bears the familiar sigil of the Ultramarines – a reminder that even the greatest can fall."
        discarded_lasgun: "A rusted, non-functional lasgun, its power cell long drained. Its presence whispers of a brief, brutal struggle before its wielder was overwhelmed."
      dialogue:
        - speaker: "Brother Valerius"
          text: "Such filth! To defile the Emperor's creations with their foul idolatry!"
          emotion: "Rage, disgust"
          context: "Upon seeing the Xenos murals."
        - speaker: "Sergeant Theron"
          text: "Quadrant sweeps at 0.5-second intervals. Movement detected. Multiple contacts, rapid approach."
          emotion: "Alert, analytical"
          context: "His vox buzzing with combat data."
        - speaker: "Brother Xylos"
          text: "They're here... the psychic static is deafening. Like a thousand needles in the mind. They know we're here."
          emotion: "Distressed, strained"
          context: "His voice tight with effort as the Genestealers draw near."
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Tyberius"
          text: "Hold formation! Remember your training, brothers! For Macragge! For Sanguinius! For the Emperor!"
          emotion: "Commanding, resolute"
          context: "As the first Genestealers burst from the shadows."
      narrative_notes: "This scene introduces the primary Xenos threat (Genestealers) and establishes their brutality. The decaying remains of previous expeditions reinforce the overwhelming odds and grim nature of the mission. Xylos' line about the psychic static deepens the Warp influence, and the initial engagement introduces Theron's methodical approach and Valerius' fervent rage. It advances the narrative by fully immersing the players in the immediate combat threat, pushing them deeper into the Hulk."
    scene_the_labyrinths_embrace:
      name: "The Labyrinth's Embrace"
      description: "You push deeper, the corridors twisting behind you like a hungry python. The very architecture seems to shift and writhe, from ancient pre-Imperium bone-metal structures humming with archaic energy, to more recognizable Imperial bulkheads marred by scorch marks and daubed with frantic, blood-red prayers. All of it is fused by crystalline growths and pulsing, sickly veins of Warp-stuff. Unsettling psionic echoes, like a chorus of whispers from beyond the veil, grow louder with every step, hinting at a presence vast and malicious, far beyond the mere chittering of Genestealers. The air grows heavy, tasting of ozone and half-forgotten dreams."
      atmosphere: "Disorienting, eerie, unsettling, growing dread."
      initial_text: "The Hulk reshapes itself around you, a living labyrinth of impossible geometries and malevolent whispers."
      examination_texts:
        pre_imperium_structure: "Smooth, impossibly strong alloys form a seamless wall, adorned with symbols alien and forgotten. Psionic energy seems to seep from its very pores, a silent, ancient song of power."
        warp_fused_corridor: "Where disparate sections of the Hulk have fused under Warp influence, jagged, organic-looking growths erupt. Strange, crystal-like formations pulse with faint, sickly light, and the air here is thick with distortional energy."
        faint_psionic_trail: "Following Xylos' strained movements, you perceive a faint, shimmering trail—the psychic residue of something immense. It leads ever deeper into the Hulk's core, an irresistible lure."
      dialogue:
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Tyberius"
          text: "Unusual. These formations... this isn't random wreckage. There's an intelligence here. Some guiding hand."
          emotion: "Pensive, analytical"
          context: "Observing the shifting architecture."
        - speaker: "Brother Xylos"
          text: "Captain, it strengthens... the presence. A grand design. Not Genestealer, but... something *using* them."
          emotion: "Disturbed, struggling for clarity"
          context: "His voice laced with effort, hand pressed to his temple."
        - speaker: "Sergeant Theron"
          text: "Sensors are losing calibration. The environment is actively distorting readings. My calculations of a defensible position are... fluid."
          emotion: "Strained, frustrated"
          context: "Trying to make sense of his flickering auspex."
        - speaker: "Brother Valerius"
          text: "Let the shadows come alive! It matters not what foul architect built this tomb, only that we cleanse it!"
          emotion: "Impatient, zealous"
          context: "His voice a low growl, impatient to face the enemy."
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Tyberius"
          text: "Patience, Brother Valerius. We move with purpose. Xylos, can you pinpoint the origin of these psychic echoes?"
          emotion: "Focused, determined"
          context: "Addressing Valerius and Xylos directly."
      narrative_notes: "This scene deepens the mystery of the Hulk, revealing it as more than just a derelict but an actively hostile, warping entity. The architectural shifts hint at ancient xenos influence and the growing Warp presence. Xylos' visions become more intense, furthering his arc. Tyberius begins questioning the overall nature of the threat. The narrative shifts focus from pure survival to unraveling the Hulk's sinister purpose."
    scene_the_hives_shadow:
      name: "The Hive's Shadow"
      description: "The narrow corridors suddenly explode into a cavernous chamber, a horrifying tableau of Xenos infestation. Crude altars fashioned from debris and human bones jut from the floor, bathed in the sickly green glow of phosphorescent fungus. Mutated human subservients, their forms grotesquely twisted and their eyes vacant with devotion, scuttle about. They tend to pulsing egg-sacs and gnaw on unidentifiable organic matter, their guttural prayers a blasphemous counterpoint to the chittering of unseen Genestealers. The air hangs heavy with the scent of ozone, unholy devotion, and the metallic tang of fresh blood."
      atmosphere: "Horrifying, defiled, disturbing, claustrophobic."
      initial_text: "You have stumbled upon the unholy sanctuary of the Genestealer Cult."
      examination_texts:
        crude_altars: "Piles of human bones, scavenged tech-junk, and strange, organic materials are arranged into crude altars dedicated to multi-limbed horrors. The air here feels thick with blasphemy."
        mutated_cultists: "Former humans, now mere husks of their past selves. Their limbs are distended, their skin mottled, and their minds utterly consumed by devotion to the Genestealers. They work with a horrifying, single-minded focus."
        pulsing_egg_sacs: "Clustered in the humid corners of the chamber, translucent egg-sacs pulse with inner life, hinting at the endless, burgeoning horde within the Hulk."
      dialogue:
        - speaker: "Brother Valerius"
          text: "By the Emperor's will! Look at these abominations! Not Xenos, but men! Defiled! We must cleanse them all!"
          emotion: "Outraged, furious"
          context: "Seeing the mutated human cultists."
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Tyberius"
          text: "Hold, Valerius! They are corrupted, yes, but once they were Imperial citizens. A grim necessity, brother, not an act of wanton slaughter."
          emotion: "Strained, conflicted"
          context: "Trying to temper Valerius' rage."
        - speaker: "Sergeant Theron"
          text: "Their numbers are significant. Collateral damage will be unavoidable if engaging in a frontal assault. Targeting key support structures would be more efficient."
          emotion: "Pragmatic, calculating"
          context: "Analyzing the situation dispassionately."
        - speaker: "Brother Xylos"
          text: "Their minds... a grotesque symphony of devotion and alien hunger. They are beyond redemption, Captain. The hive mind's grip is absolute."
          emotion: "Somber, resolute"
          context: "After extending his psychic senses to the cultists."
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Tyberius"
          text: "Then let the Emperor judge their souls. But let our fury be precise. Theron, breach their defenses. Valerius, secure the line. Xylos, defend our minds against their corrupted prayers. FOR SANGUINIUS!"
          emotion: "Resigned but firm, leading the attack"
          context: "Making a difficult command decision."
      narrative_notes: "This scene introduces the moral dilemma of the Genestealer Cult, challenging the characters' preconceived notions of purity and enemy. Tyberius confronts the grim necessity of eradicating corrupted humanity, deepening his arc. Valerius' rage intensifies, bringing him closer to the Black Rage. Theron maintains pragmatism, while Xylos confirms the cultists' utter corruption. This advances the plot by revealing another layer of the Xenos threat and forcing the squad into a new type of combat."
    scene_echoes_of_the_great_enemy:
      name: "Echoes of the Great Enemy"
      description: "The Hulk's internal landscape has dissolved into a nightmarish canvas of impossible geometry and flickering reality. The Warp's presence here is undeniable, thick and cloying as a shroud. Visions plague your retinas: corridors stretch into infinity, then contort into impossible knots. Time splinters, slowing to a crawl then lashing forward in disorienting bursts. At the periphery of your perception, grotesque, minor Warp entities – chittering imps of shadow, serpentine energies, or skeletal apparitions – flicker in and out of existence, drawn by the raw psychic energy. The very air pulses with malevolent sentience, the entire Hulk groaning as if it were a colossal, waking beast, bending reality to its sinister will."
      atmosphere: "Surreal, horrifying, disorienting, maddening, desperate."
      initial_text: "The Warp bleeds into reality here, threatening to consume your very sanity."
      examination_texts:
        shifting_walls: "The bulkheads shimmer, their metallic surfaces momentarily dissolving into star-charts of unknown constellations or the screaming visages of the damned before snapping back to solid steel. A trick of the Warp."
        flickering_daemons: "Ephemeral, insect-like shadows dance just outside your direct gaze, some coalescing into fleeting forms of tooth and claw, only to dissipate into smoke when directly observed. They whisper promises of power and damnation."
        stuttering_time_rift: "A small, localized anomaly where time itself is fractured. A single moment replays incessantly, a cultist's dying scream or the metallic sheen of a Xenos claw, trapped in an eternal loop."
      dialogue:
        - speaker: "Brother Xylos"
          text: "No... no, I cannot hold it! The whispers... they're truths from beyond! The Hulk... it is a conduit! A dagger in the void!"
          emotion: "Overwhelmed, frantic, terrified"
          context: "As the Warp phenomena intensify, clutching his head."
        - speaker: "Sergeant Theron"
          text: "My-my readings are meaningless. The environment is... hostile to physics. This is beyond tactical probability."
          emotion: "Strained, shaken (a rare display)"

          context: "His armor sparking with minor energy discharges as he fights against the hallucinations."
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Tyberius"
          text: "Xylos, focus! Theron, trust your instincts, not your faulty machines! Brothers, this is the Great Enemy's hand at work. Push through the madness! We are the Emperor's will made manifest!"
          emotion: "Forced calm, inspiring, a flicker of his own strain"
          context: "Trying to maintain control and rally his squad."
      narrative_notes: "This scene highlights the corrupting and disorienting power of the Warp, testing the mental fortitude of all characters. Xylos is pushed to the brink of overwhelming psychic assault, fully engaging his arc. Theron's stoicism cracks under the weight of illogical horrors. Tyberius' leadership is crucial here, as is his own internal struggle against the madness. It increases the stakes, signaling that the ultimate threat is not merely physical but existential, leading directly to the source of this power."
    scene_the_ancient_core:
      name: "The Ancient Core"
      description: "You breach a vast, cylindrical chamber – not like any part of the Space Hulk you've seen before. This is the heart of 'The Serpent's Coil,' an ancient, pre-Imperium alien vessel, perfectly integrated and terrifyingly intact amidst the surrounding wreckage. Its walls glow with faint, shifting sigils of unknown origin, pulsing with both Xenos and Warp energies that hum a low, resonant thrum. Holographic projections shimmer at the chamber's center, depicting star charts and biomechanical designs, hinting at a grand, insidious design: a Tyranid vanguard orchestrated by a forgotten intelligence, now amplified and directed by the Warp. This place radiates purpose, alien and malevolent, chilling you to the very core of your being."

        navigational_console: "An alien console, devoid of any discernible controls, pulses with a steady, malevolent light. It is active, calculating a trajectory through the void, its destination hidden but its purpose clear: a weapon aimed at the heart of the Imperium."
        organic_warp_conduits: "Thick, pulsating tubes of living tissue snake across the chamber, tapping directly into the Warp's energy. They seem to feed the entire core, amplifying its power and influence."

          context: "Grasping the scale of the threat."
        - speaker: "Brother Xylos"
          text: "The visions... they were warnings. I see it now clearly. The Serpent's Coil. It breathes with the Hive Mind, Captain. And the Warp guides its breath."

          context: "His voice now clearer, though still strained, as the truth is revealed."
        - speaker: "Sergeant Theron"
          text: "Analyzing trajectory data... impossible. It's charting a course directly for Segmentum Solar, or a major Agri-World within. Billions of lives."

          context: "His lightning claws sparking with unholy zeal."
        - speaker: "Brother-Captain Tyberius"
          text: "Indeed. But not without understanding the full scope. The psychic signature... it emanates from further within. The master of this abomination awaits."
          emotion: "Determined, strategic"
          context: "Steeling himself for the ultimate confrontation."
      narrative_notes: "This scene acts as the major plot revelation, exposing the true nature and peril of the Hulk. Tyberius comprehends the strategic disaster facing the Imperium, deepening his sense of command and burden. Xylos' psychic abilities are pivotal in understanding the threat, bringing his arc full circle in its revelatory capacity. The purpose of heading to the Broodlord's Lair is made clear: deactivate the beacon and destroy the guiding intelligence."

      description: "Passing through what appears to be a natural organic archway, you step into a vast, pulsating chamber. Clustered around a central, gnarled outcropping of bio-matter, stands a creature of nightmares: the Broodlord. It is a grotesque titan, easily twice the size of its lesser brethren, encased in a chitinous armor that shimmers with an oily sheen. Its four mighty talons click and scrape against the floor, and its massive, lamprey-like mouth twitches with malevolent sentience. A palpable wave of psychic energy emanates from it, a telepathic roar that threatens to shatter your very thoughts, broadcasting its vile beacon into the void. Surrounding it are its hand-picked synaptic guards, sleek and deadly, their minds connected to its own with disturbing intimacy. This isn't just a physical threat; it's a battle for cosmic survival."

Valerius' Black Rage is fully engaged, providing both strength and danger, representing the peak of his arc. Xylos pushes his psychic abilities to their absolute limit, risking everything to break the Broodlord's mental defenses. Theron's tactical acumen is applied to a formidable foe. Tyberius must lead the squad through this impossible fight, embodying the weight of command and the desperate nature of their mission."

      description: "With the Broodlord's grotesque form collapsing into a quivering mass of chitin and gore, a chilling silence descends upon the ancient core. The intense psychic static recedes, replaced by a cold, undeniable truth. Holographic displays across the alien chamber flicker, no longer distorted by the psychic beast, and the grim reality of the Hulk's trajectory blazes forth: Imperial Sector-Alpha. A vital agri-world, teeming with billions of souls, unknowingly awaiting its demise. Your Chapter's Battle Barge, 'The Blade of Sanguinius,' hangs in orbit nearby, a distant star, but its mighty shields whisper of the overwhelming Warp-tainted field engulfing the Hulk. Direct intervention is suicide. An impossible choice now looms, the fate of an Imperial world resting heavy on your ceramite-clad shoulders."

          text: "Three options, Captain. One: self-destruct the core, but success probability is negligible without complete systems control. Two: reroute trajectory, highly risky, unknown outcome for the target. Three: Signal the Battle Barge for ramming protocol; guaranteed destruction, but the Chapter would be crippled."

      narrative_notes: "This is the narrative's central decision point, the culmination of all the previous discoveries and conflicts. Tyberius faces an impossible moral dilemma, weighing lives and duty. Theron's pragmatism provides stark options. Xylos, though weary, offers his grim truth. Valerius' ultimate loyalty and readiness for glorious death are highlighted. This scene explicitly primes the player for the final decision, leading directly into one of the three climax scenarios based on the player's choice."

They know your intent, sensing the impending doom of their psychic heart. It is a tide of chitin and muscle, a furious, clawing, all-consuming wave. Your brothers form a desperate circle, their bolters and power weapons carving bloody arcs through the endless throng. This is your glorious Last Stand, a final, desperate act to save billions, fought in the Emperor's name.

Valerius fully succumbs to the Black Rage, achieving a glorious but destined death. Xylos makes a final, self-destructive push with his psychic power.

      narrative_notes: "This scene portrays a desperate and complex struggle against both the tangible Xenos and the intangible Warp. Theron's pragmatism is severely tested by the illogical nature of the Warp influence but he uses his tactical intellect for this gambit. Xylos risks madness and self-destruction to maintain the psychic override, making his visions clearer and more disturbing. Tyberius must lead his squad through this maelstrom of unreality, showcasing his ability to adapt under pressure.

Tyberius makes the agonizing decision, prioritizing the survival of his remaining brothers even as he sacrifices his home.

It is merely deferred, left to fester, to become something unimaginable within that maelstrom. What horrors will breed in the Nebula's heart? What new, unholy entity might claw its way back to reality from that festering wound?

      narrative_notes: "This aftermath explores the moral ambiguity of a Pyrrhic victory. Tyberius is left with the heavy burden of his 'choice,' aware of the unknown consequences and the grim reality of the Imperium's constant struggle. Xylos' arc concludes with profound mental scars, forever haunted by the malevolent energies of the Nebula. Theron's pragmatism is challenged by the boundless illogicality of the Warp, leaving him with lingering unease.

Its gaping maw of a docking bay yawns before your Thunderhawk, a maelstrom of void-dust and flickering emergency lights casting long, grotesque shadows. Inside, the air is thick with the metallic tang of decay and the cloying sweetness of organic infestation. Alarms shriek their death throes as your squad of Blood Angels Terminators, clad in their revered power armor, descends into the belly of the beast. Suddenly, the world explodes into a symphony of screeching claws, chittering xenos, and the thunderous roar of bolters. Chaos erupts. Your brothers fall, torn asunder by unseen horrors in the flickering gloom, their cries swallowed by the monstrous cacophony. The coordinated insertion shatters, replaced by desperate, isolated skirmishes. Valerius finds himself alone, surrounded by the mangled remains of his brethren, the Red Thirst a savage whisper at the edge of his awareness, threatening to consume him.",

The Hulk's ancient metal is almost entirely consumed by a pulsating, biomechanical growth – the true, vile heart of the Genestealer infestation. The walls writhe with unseen life, and strange, viscous fluids drip from chitinous ceilings. The air is thick, choked with the acrid scent of alien biology and the overwhelming psychic roar of the Patriarch, now amplified to maddening levels by the shard’s proximity. Xenos forms, larger, more cunning, and more numerous than any you’ve faced, scuttle in the periphery. Brother Tiberius, now a whirlwind of crimson fury, his growls barely coherent, lunges ahead, almost blindly, a living weapon. Arion, depending on your choice, either walks with a terrifying resolve, his eyes blazing with power, or a desperate, almost terrified grimace, struggling against the psychic onslaught. Valerius, your own Black Rage now a roaring beast at the gates of your mind, must harness it, shaping the raw fury into focused, brutal efficiency.",

Its silent presence twists the air, makes your teeth ache, and drives the Black Rage to a fever pitch. Guarding it stands the Patriarch, bloated and terrible, its form mutated and enhanced by the shard's influence, its carapace shimmering with an unholy glow, flanked by its most elite, monstrous brood. As the final battle begins, a forgotten console hums to life, its ancient screen displaying a dire warning and a single, catastrophic option: The Doomsday Protocol – a full-spectrum core destabilization, designed to obliterate the Hulk and anything within it.

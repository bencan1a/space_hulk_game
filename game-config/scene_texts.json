The violent breach deafened, compressed air rushing out into the void, followed by a torrent of space debris. Now, the interior is an oppressive, silent nightmare – a labyrinth of decaying corridors woven from the skeletal remains of countless vessels. Zero-gravity chambers shimmer with motes of ancient dust, stirred by the intrusion, clinging to fractured bulkheads and organic growths that defy Imperial understanding. The air is thick with the metallic stench of stagnant machinery, decay, and something else, something subtly alien and unsettling.",

        "narrative_notes": "This scene introduces an optional branching path, driven by Valerius's and Lyra's scientific curiosity. It deepens the mystery of the Space Hulk and hints at a cosmic horror beyond the Genestealer Cult. The 'investigate_ancient' decision point allows players to either stick to the primary mission (leading to 'scene_first_genestealers') or delve deeper into the lore (leading directly to 'scene_xenos_cathedral'), profoundly altering the early pacing and revelations of the narrative."

# Space Hulk Game - Agent Definitions
#
# This file defines the specialized AI agents that collaborate to create game content.
#
# ## Agent Architecture
#
# ### Sequential Mode (Default)
# All 6 agents work as peers, each completing their assigned tasks in order:
# - NarrativeDirectorAgent: Evaluates and ensures narrative cohesion
# - PlotMasterAgent: Creates overarching plot structure
# - NarrativeArchitectAgent: Maps plot into detailed scenes
# - PuzzleSmithAgent: Designs puzzles, artifacts, and challenges
# - CreativeScribeAgent: Writes descriptions and dialogue
# - MechanicsGuruAgent: Defines game mechanics and systems
#
# ### Hierarchical Mode (Advanced)
# NarrativeDirectorAgent acts as manager, coordinating the 5 specialist agents:
# - Manager: NarrativeDirectorAgent (evaluates quality, requests revisions)
# - Workers: PlotMaster, NarrativeArchitect, PuzzleSmith, CreativeScribe, MechanicsGuru
#
# ## Agent Configuration Best Practices
#
# ### Key Parameters
# - role: Agent's job title/role (e.g., "Lead Plot Designer")
# - goal: What the agent aims to achieve
# - backstory: Context about the agent's expertise and experience
# - allow_delegation: Enable task delegation (typically True for manager, False for workers)
# - verbose: Enable detailed logging (True for debugging)
#
# ### LLM Assignment
# All agents use the same LLM (Ollama/qwen2.5) configured in crew.py.
# In advanced configurations, the manager could use a more capable model.
#
# ### Tool Assignment
# Currently no custom tools are assigned. Future enhancements could add:
# - File validation tools for checking YAML structure
# - Web search for lore accuracy
# - Code generation tools for game mechanics
#
# ## Design Philosophy
#
# Each agent is specialized but collaborates toward a cohesive whole:
# 1. Narrative-first approach (plot drives all other elements)
# 2. Clear separation of concerns (each agent has distinct responsibility)
# 3. Iterative refinement (evaluation tasks ensure quality)
# 4. Thematic consistency (all elements align with established narrative)

# Space Hulk Game - Task Definitions
#
# This file defines the tasks executed by the CrewAI agents to generate a complete game.
#
# ## Task Execution Flow
#
# ### Sequential Mode (Default)
# Tasks execute in the order they are defined and instantiated in crew.py:
# 1. GenerateOverarchingPlot -> 2. CreateNarrativeMap -> 3. DesignArtifactsAndPuzzles
# 4. WriteSceneDescriptionsAndDialogue -> 5. CreateGameMechanicsPRD
# Plus evaluation tasks: EvaluateNarrativeFoundation, EvaluateNarrativeStructure,
# NarrativeIntegrationCheckPuzzles, NarrativeIntegrationCheckScenes,
# NarrativeIntegrationCheckMechanics, FinalNarrativeIntegration
#
# ### Hierarchical Mode (Advanced)
# The NarrativeDirectorAgent manages task delegation and ensures quality.
# Tasks are delegated based on dependencies and agent specialization.
#
# ## Task Configuration Best Practices
#
# ### Context vs Dependencies
# - **context**: Provides information from previous tasks (read-only access to outputs)
# - **dependencies**: Enforces execution order (task X must complete before task Y)
#
# ### Avoiding Deadlocks
# - Keep dependency chains simple and linear where possible
# - Avoid circular dependencies (A depends on B, B depends on A)
# - In hierarchical mode, evaluation tasks should not create complex dependency webs
#
# ### Task Structure
# Each task includes:
# - name: Human-readable task name
# - description: Clear instructions for the agent
# - expected_output: Specific format and content requirements
# - agent: Agent responsible for executing the task
# - context: Previous task outputs to reference (optional)
# - dependencies: Tasks that must complete first (optional)
# - output_file: File to save task output (optional)
#
# ## Simplified Task Flow for Phase 0 Testing
#
# For initial validation (per REVISED_RESTART_PLAN.md), test with just the 5 core tasks:
# 1. GenerateOverarchingPlot
# 2. CreateNarrativeMap
# 3. DesignArtifactsAndPuzzles
# 4. WriteSceneDescriptionsAndDialogue
# 5. CreateGameMechanicsPRD
#
# Then incrementally add evaluation tasks one at a time to identify hanging points.

# Initial narrative foundation - must be completed and approved first
GenerateOverarchingPlot:
  name: "Generate Comprehensive Narrative Foundation"
  description: >
    Create a comprehensive narrative foundation for the Space Hulk game. This foundation must be
    detailed enough to guide all subsequent development, establishing the setting, key plot points,
    themes, tone, and central conflicts. This narrative foundation is the critical first step that
    all other development will build upon.

    **IMPORTANT: Output must be in valid YAML format with the following structure:**
    ```yaml
    narrative_foundation:
      title: "Game Title"
      setting: "Detailed setting description"
      themes:
        - theme1
        - theme2
      tone: "Description of narrative tone"
      plot_points:
        - id: "plot1"
          name: "Plot Point Name"
          description: "Description"
        - id: "plot2"
          name: "Another Plot Point"
          description: "Description"
      characters:
        - name: "Character Name"
          role: "Role description"
          backstory: "Character background"
      conflicts:
        - type: "Conflict Type"
          description: "Conflict description"
    ```
  expected_output: >
    A valid YAML document following the structure above that clearly defines the game's setting,
    core narrative themes, major plot points, key characters, central conflicts, and narrative
    tone. The output MUST be parseable YAML, not markdown or plain text.

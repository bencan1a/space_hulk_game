# Space Hulk Game - Task Definitions
#
# This file defines the tasks executed by the CrewAI agents to generate a complete game.
#
# ## Task Execution Flow
#
# ### Sequential Mode (Default)
# Tasks execute in the order they are defined and instantiated in crew.py:
# 1. GenerateOverarchingPlot -> 2. CreateNarrativeMap -> 3. DesignArtifactsAndPuzzles
# 4. WriteSceneDescriptionsAndDialogue -> 5. CreateGameMechanicsPRD
# Plus evaluation tasks: EvaluateNarrativeFoundation, EvaluateNarrativeStructure,
# NarrativeIntegrationCheckPuzzles, NarrativeIntegrationCheckScenes,
# NarrativeIntegrationCheckMechanics, FinalNarrativeIntegration
#
# ### Hierarchical Mode (Advanced)
# The NarrativeDirectorAgent manages task delegation and ensures quality.
# Tasks are delegated based on dependencies and agent specialization.
#
# ## Task Configuration Best Practices
#
# ### Context vs Dependencies
# - **context**: Provides information from previous tasks (read-only access to outputs)
# - **dependencies**: Enforces execution order (task X must complete before task Y)
#
# ### Avoiding Deadlocks
# - Keep dependency chains simple and linear where possible
# - Avoid circular dependencies (A depends on B, B depends on A)
# - In hierarchical mode, evaluation tasks should not create complex dependency webs
#
# ### Task Structure
# Each task includes:
# - name: Human-readable task name
# - description: Clear instructions for the agent
# - expected_output: Specific format and content requirements
# - agent: Agent responsible for executing the task
# - context: Previous task outputs to reference (optional)
# - dependencies: Tasks that must complete first (optional)
# - output_file: File to save task output (optional)
#
# ## Simplified Task Flow for Phase 0 Testing
#
# For initial validation (per REVISED_RESTART_PLAN.md), test with just the 5 core tasks:
# 1. GenerateOverarchingPlot
# 2. CreateNarrativeMap  
# 3. DesignArtifactsAndPuzzles
# 4. WriteSceneDescriptionsAndDialogue
# 5. CreateGameMechanicsPRD
#
# Then incrementally add evaluation tasks one at a time to identify hanging points.

# Initial narrative foundation - must be completed and approved first
GenerateOverarchingPlot:
  name: "Generate Comprehensive Narrative Foundation"
  description: >
    Create a comprehensive narrative foundation for the Space Hulk game. This foundation must be 
    detailed enough to guide all subsequent development, establishing the setting, key plot points, 
    themes, tone, and central conflicts. This narrative foundation is the critical first step that 
    all other development will build upon.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed narrative foundation document that clearly defines the game's setting, core 
    narrative themes, major plot points, key characters, central conflicts, and narrative 
    tone. This document must be comprehensive enough to serve as the guiding framework for 
    all subsequent development work.

EvaluateNarrativeFoundation:
  name: "Evaluate Narrative Foundation"
  description: >
    Evaluate the narrative foundation for story quality, thematic depth, and emotional engagement.
    Focus on: Does the plot have compelling hooks? Are themes clearly established? Will the story
    resonate emotionally? Is the pacing effective? Does it set up meaningful player choices?
    This is a narrative quality assessment, not technical validation.
  expected_output: >
    A narrative quality evaluation assessing plot hooks, thematic development, emotional resonance,
    and story pacing. Provide specific feedback on how to strengthen the narrative foundation.

    all critical paths, character arcs, decision points, and narrative progression. This
    structure will direct all subsequent content creation by specialists.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive narrative structure that clearly defines all scenes, connections, character 
    moments, key decision points, and narrative progression in a structured format that can
    guide specialized development work.

EvaluateNarrativeStructure:
  name: "Evaluate Narrative Structure"
  description: >
    Evaluate the narrative structure for story flow, scene pacing, and narrative coherence.
    Focus on: Do scenes flow naturally? Are story beats well-placed? Does the structure
    support the themes? Are character moments effective? Is the narrative arc satisfying?
    This is about narrative craft, not technical details.
  expected_output: >
    A narrative structure assessment evaluating scene flow, story pacing, thematic support,
    and narrative arc. Provide specific feedback on strengthening the narrative structure.

    any dead ends or impossible situations? Do mechanics work consistently throughout?
    Is the difficulty curve appropriate? This is the final technical playability check.

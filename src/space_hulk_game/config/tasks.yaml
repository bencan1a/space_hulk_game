# Initial narrative foundation - must be completed and approved first
GenerateOverarchingPlot:
  name: "Generate Comprehensive Narrative Foundation"
  description: >
    Create a comprehensive narrative foundation for the Space Hulk game. This foundation must be 
    detailed enough to guide all subsequent development, establishing the setting, key plot points, 
    themes, tone, and central conflicts. This narrative foundation is the critical first step that 
    all other development will build upon.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed narrative foundation document that clearly defines the game's setting, core 
    narrative themes, major plot points, key characters, central conflicts, and narrative 
    tone. This document must be comprehensive enough to serve as the guiding framework for 
    all subsequent development work.

EvaluateNarrativeFoundation:
  name: "Evaluate Narrative Foundation"
  description: >
    Thoroughly evaluate the narrative foundation to ensure it provides sufficient depth, clarity,
    and direction for all subsequent development. This is a critical quality gate - subsequent 
    work cannot proceed until a strong narrative foundation is established.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive evaluation of the narrative foundation with specific feedback for improvement.
    Include explicit approval or revision requests. Only when approved can development proceed
    to the next phase.

# Narrative structure - can only proceed after foundation approval
CreateNarrativeMap:
  name: "Develop Detailed Narrative Structure"
  description: >
    Based on the approved narrative foundation, develop a detailed narrative map that defines
    all critical paths, character arcs, decision points, and narrative progression. This
    structure will direct all subsequent content creation by specialists.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive narrative structure that clearly defines all scenes, connections, character 
    moments, key decision points, and narrative progression in a structured format that can
    guide specialized development work.

EvaluateNarrativeStructure:
  name: "Evaluate Narrative Structure"
  description: >
    Thoroughly evaluate the narrative structure to ensure it adequately develops the approved 
    foundation into an implementable blueprint for all specialized development. This is a 
    critical quality gate - specialist work cannot fully proceed until the narrative structure 
    is approved.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed evaluation of the narrative structure with specific feedback. Include explicit

DesignArtifactsAndPuzzles:
  name: "Create Narrative-Integrated Puzzles and Artifacts"
  description: >
    Based on the approved narrative structure, design puzzles, artifacts, monsters, and NPCs
    that directly serve and enhance the established narrative. Each element must have clear 
    connections to the narrative themes, advance the story in meaningful ways, and maintain
    thematic consistency.

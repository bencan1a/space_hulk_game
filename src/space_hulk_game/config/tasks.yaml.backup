# Space Hulk Game - Task Definitions
#
# This file defines the tasks executed by the CrewAI agents to generate a complete game.
#
# ## Task Execution Flow
#
# ### Sequential Mode (Default)
# Tasks execute in the order they are defined and instantiated in crew.py:
# 1. GenerateOverarchingPlot -> 2. CreateNarrativeMap -> 3. DesignArtifactsAndPuzzles
# 4. WriteSceneDescriptionsAndDialogue -> 5. CreateGameMechanicsPRD
# Plus evaluation tasks: EvaluateNarrativeFoundation, EvaluateNarrativeStructure,
# NarrativeIntegrationCheckPuzzles, NarrativeIntegrationCheckScenes,
# NarrativeIntegrationCheckMechanics, FinalNarrativeIntegration
#
# ### Hierarchical Mode (Advanced)
# The NarrativeDirectorAgent manages task delegation and ensures quality.
# Tasks are delegated based on dependencies and agent specialization.
#
# ## Task Configuration Best Practices
#
# ### Context vs Dependencies
# - **context**: Provides information from previous tasks (read-only access to outputs)
# - **dependencies**: Enforces execution order (task X must complete before task Y)
#
# ### Avoiding Deadlocks
# - Keep dependency chains simple and linear where possible
# - Avoid circular dependencies (A depends on B, B depends on A)
# - In hierarchical mode, evaluation tasks should not create complex dependency webs
#
# ### Task Structure
# Each task includes:
# - name: Human-readable task name
# - description: Clear instructions for the agent
# - expected_output: Specific format and content requirements
# - agent: Agent responsible for executing the task
# - context: Previous task outputs to reference (optional)
# - dependencies: Tasks that must complete first (optional)
# - output_file: File to save task output (optional)
#
# ## Simplified Task Flow for Phase 0 Testing
#
# For initial validation (per REVISED_RESTART_PLAN.md), test with just the 5 core tasks:
# 1. GenerateOverarchingPlot
# 2. CreateNarrativeMap  
# 3. DesignArtifactsAndPuzzles
# 4. WriteSceneDescriptionsAndDialogue
# 5. CreateGameMechanicsPRD
#
# Then incrementally add evaluation tasks one at a time to identify hanging points.

# Initial narrative foundation - must be completed and approved first
GenerateOverarchingPlot:
  name: "Generate Comprehensive Narrative Foundation"
  description: >
    Create a comprehensive narrative foundation for the Space Hulk game. This foundation must be 
    detailed enough to guide all subsequent development, establishing the setting, key plot points, 
    themes, tone, and central conflicts. This narrative foundation is the critical first step that 
    all other development will build upon.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed narrative foundation document that clearly defines the game's setting, core 
    narrative themes, major plot points, key characters, central conflicts, and narrative 
    tone. This document must be comprehensive enough to serve as the guiding framework for 
    all subsequent development work.
  agent: "PlotMasterAgent"
  output_file: "game-config/plot_outline.yaml"

EvaluateNarrativeFoundation:
  name: "Evaluate Narrative Foundation"
  description: >
    Thoroughly evaluate the narrative foundation to ensure it provides sufficient depth, clarity,
    and direction for all subsequent development. This is a critical quality gate - subsequent 
    work cannot proceed until a strong narrative foundation is established.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive evaluation of the narrative foundation with specific feedback for improvement.
    Include explicit approval or revision requests. Only when approved can development proceed
    to the next phase.
  agent: "NarrativeDirectorAgent"
  context:
    - "GenerateOverarchingPlot"
  dependencies:
    - "GenerateOverarchingPlot"

# Narrative structure - can only proceed after foundation approval
CreateNarrativeMap:
  name: "Develop Detailed Narrative Structure"
  description: >
    Based on the approved narrative foundation, develop a detailed narrative map that defines
    all critical paths, character arcs, decision points, and narrative progression. This
    structure will direct all subsequent content creation by specialists.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive narrative structure that clearly defines all scenes, connections, character 
    moments, key decision points, and narrative progression in a structured format that can
    guide specialized development work.
  agent: "NarrativeArchitectAgent"
  context:
    - "GenerateOverarchingPlot"
    # Removed EvaluateNarrativeFoundation from context to avoid "context dependency on a future task" error
  dependencies:
    - "EvaluateNarrativeFoundation"  # Keeping execution dependency to maintain correct task order
  output_file: "game-config/narrative_map.yaml"

EvaluateNarrativeStructure:
  name: "Evaluate Narrative Structure"
  description: >
    Thoroughly evaluate the narrative structure to ensure it adequately develops the approved 
    foundation into an implementable blueprint for all specialized development. This is a 
    critical quality gate - specialist work cannot fully proceed until the narrative structure 
    is approved.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed evaluation of the narrative structure with specific feedback. Include explicit
    approval or revision requests. Only when approved can specialist development fully proceed.

# Specialized tasks - can only begin meaningful work after narrative structure approval
DesignArtifactsAndPuzzles:
  name: "Create Narrative-Integrated Puzzles and Artifacts"
  description: >
    Based on the approved narrative structure, design puzzles, artifacts, monsters, and NPCs
    that directly serve and enhance the established narrative. Each element must have clear 
    connections to the narrative themes, advance the story in meaningful ways, and maintain
    thematic consistency.
  expected_output: >
    A collection of puzzle, artifact, monster, and NPC designs that are tightly integrated
    with the narrative. Each design must include explicit explanations of how it connects to
    and advances the established narrative.

NarrativeIntegrationCheckPuzzles:
  name: "Narrative Integration Check: Puzzles"

    Evaluate how well the puzzles, artifacts, monsters, and NPCs integrate with and
    advance the established narrative. Ensure each element serves the narrative purpose
    defined in the structure and maintains thematic consistency.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed assessment of narrative integration for each puzzle element with specific
    feedback for improving narrative cohesion where needed.

WriteSceneDescriptionsAndDialogue:
  name: "Write Narrative-Driven Scene Descriptions"
  description: >
    Based on the approved narrative structure, write scene descriptions and dialogue
    that bring the narrative to life. Each scene must accurately reflect its place in
    the narrative structure, advance the story appropriately, and maintain consistent
    tone and themes.
  expected_output: >

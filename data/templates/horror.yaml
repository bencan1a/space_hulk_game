prompt: |
  Create a gothic horror text-based adventure game with the following specifications:

  **Setting**: {{ setting }}
  **Primary Threat**: {{ threat }}
  **Atmosphere**: {{ atmosphere }}
  **Duration**: {{ duration }}

  The story should emphasize:
  - **Atmospheric dread**: Build tension through environment descriptions
  - **Isolation**: The player should feel alone and vulnerable
  - **Body horror**: Include visceral, disturbing imagery when appropriate
  - **Limited resources**: Create scarcity to increase tension
  - **Sound design**: Use audio cues described in text to heighten fear

  Design the game with:
  - Multiple branching paths based on player choices
  - Environmental storytelling through item descriptions and scene details
  - Gradual revelation of the true horror through exploration
  - Consequences for rash decisions
  - At least one "safe room" where players can catch their breath

  Include puzzle elements that require observation and careful thinking, not just combat.
  The horror should be psychological as well as physical.

  Generate a complete game.json structure with all necessary scenes, items, NPCs, and game logic.

  Create an artifact hunt text-based adventure game with the following specifications:

  **Artifact**: {{ artifact_name }}
  **Location**: {{ location }}
  **Opposition**: {{ opposition }}
  **Difficulty**: {{ difficulty }}
  {% if time_pressure %}**Time Pressure**: Mission is time-sensitive{% endif %}

  The mission should feature:

  - **Obstacles**: Challenges that must be overcome to reach the artifact
  - **Risk vs. Reward**: Optional areas with valuable items but increased danger

  - Meaningful choices that affect the outcome
  - Resource management (equipment, supplies)
  - Potential complications if the artifact is activated incorrectly
  
  Include:
  - At least 3 key puzzle or challenge areas
  - NPCs who may help or hinder the search
  - Lore entries that reveal the artifact's backstory
  - Multiple possible endings based on how the artifact is handled
  
  {% if time_pressure %}
  Add time pressure elements:
  - Limited turns or time before reinforcements arrive
  - Consequences for taking too long
  - Environmental hazards that worsen over time
  {% endif %}
  
  Generate a complete game.json structure with all necessary scenes, items, NPCs, and game logic.

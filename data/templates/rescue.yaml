  Create a rescue mission text-based adventure game with the following specifications:

  **Rescue Target**: {{ rescue_target }}
  **Location**: {{ location }}
  **Captors**: {{ captors }}
  **Target Condition**: {{ target_condition }}
  **Extraction Method**: {{ extraction_method }}

  The mission should emphasize:
  - **Infiltration**: Getting into the facility without raising alarms
  - **Intel gathering**: Finding the exact location of the rescue target
  - **Time sensitivity**: The target's condition may deteriorate
  - **Stealth vs. Combat**: Players can choose their approach
  - **Escort mechanics**: Protecting the target during extraction
  
  Design the game with:
  - A clear three-phase structure: infiltration, rescue, extraction
  - Multiple entry points and approaches to the facility
  - Alarm system that changes the mission if triggered
  - NPC allies who can provide support or distractions
  - Complications based on the target's condition
  
  Include:
  - At least 2 different infiltration routes (stealth, disguise, or frontal assault)
  - Guards with patrol patterns that can be observed and exploited
  - Environmental hazards that can be used tactically
  - Moral choices (rescue everyone vs. just the primary target)
  - Time-sensitive decisions during the extraction phase
  
  The target ({{ rescue_target }}) should:
  - Have personality and agency (not just a passive objective)
  - Potentially provide valuable information
  - Have specific needs based on their condition ({{ target_condition }})
  - Affect gameplay during the extraction phase
  
  Extraction ({{ extraction_method }}) should:
  - Present unique challenges based on the method
  - Require defending the target until extraction is complete
  - Have potential complications that must be overcome
  
  Include multiple endings:
  - Clean extraction with minimal casualties
  - Costly success with heavy losses
  - Failed rescue with consequences
  - Unexpected complications that change the mission
  
  Generate a complete game.json structure with all necessary scenes, items, NPCs, and game logic.
